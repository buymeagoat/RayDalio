0:00
- Ray, when you were building
0:01
everything, what motivated you?
0:03
Was it knowledge or money?
0:05
- It was really the game.
0:08
I love the fact that I could be tested in the real world
0:11
because I'm having these interactions
0:14
and I love the fact that I'm scored every day.
0:16
I could score how I'm doing to three decibel places.
0:19
You know,
0:27
- Showtime! Ray Dalio built one
0:30
of the world's biggest hedge funds.
0:32
Now he's exploring the deep.
0:35
How often are you on the boat, Ray?
0:37
- Well, often, let's say I'm probably on the boat six times
0:41
a year, but I spend maybe a couple of weeks
0:44
- And it's all over the place. Right? All over the
0:45
- World.
0:46
All over the place.
0:49
- We met him on board his research vessel in the Port
0:52
of Nice, where the United Nations Oceans Conference was in
0:55
full swing. At events like
1:00
these world leaders, NGOs, big business
1:03
and stakeholders gather to raise awareness
1:06
and address the urgent needs of our waters.
1:10
So is President Lula coming? I,
1:12
- It's on and off and it's on and off,
1:14
but he is supposed to come with President Macron,
1:16
but these things come and go.
1:19
- They're held up. I know what it's like.
1:30
- I, I, I love mistakes.
1:34
I love problems
1:35
because I think all of that is part of the process.
1:38
It's the way you learn.
1:41
So we're at a critical time
1:43
and I want to, again, give you my perspective.
1:46
- Ray Dalio is famous and prolific,
1:49
- As you might know.
1:50
My objective at this stage of my life is
1:53
to pass along the principles, perspectives
1:55
and tools that have helped me.
1:57
- He founded Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund
2:00
that consistently ranks amongst the largest in the world.
2:05
Bridgewater's growth led Dalio
2:06
to write the principles in 2017
2:10
and propelled him into the mainstream.
2:13
In recent times, he's become, well, a bit of an influencer.
2:18
- Whatever success I've had in life has had to do more
2:22
with my knowing how to deal
2:23
with not knowing than anything I know.
2:27
- Ray Dalio, thank you so much for joining us.
2:30
- Thank you for joining me here.
2:32
On OceanX.
2:33
- It's the most beautiful boat. Ray, talk
2:34
to me a little bit about your childhood.
2:37
Where, where did you grow up?
2:38
What was your neighborhood like?
2:40
- I grew up on Long Island.
2:45
My neighborhood was a bunch of houses next to each other,
2:49
pretty small houses.
2:51
So it was a not a big place.
2:54
- And do, do you remember your first job?
2:56
- Yeah, well my first job was a paper route
2:59
and then I would shovel snow on driveways and,
3:04
but then my real job when I was 12 is I got into caddying
3:09
and that changed my life. Had a big impact.
3:12
- And why did it change your life?
3:13
- Because the people, I was caddying for it.
3:15
The time in the sixties we're always talking
3:18
about the stock market.
3:20
So I took my caddying money
3:22
and I put it into the stock market and I got hooked.
3:27
I bought the only company that I ever heard of
3:30
that was selling for less than $5 a share.
3:33
The company I bought was about to go broke, so it was cheap.
3:36
And then another company acquired it
3:38
and it tripled in money.
3:40
And so I said this making money is easy in the markets.
3:45
And so I got hooked.
3:47
- This is at what, 12? - Yeah,
3:49
- 13, - 12.
3:50
- And then did you decide at 12 years old to,
3:52
to get into financial
3:54
- Services?
3:55
It was just like a game,
3:56
- Right?
3:57
- I love playing the game.
3:58
You know, stocks went up then and you could be lucky
4:01
and think you were smart.
4:04
- Okay, so, so what happens after that?
4:05
You go to, you finish school?
4:06
- I went to school and then in 1973 I was in graduate
4:11
school, Harvard Business School.
4:14
And then I went out to work in commodities.
4:18
- So when did you decide to found Bridgewater?
4:21
- 1975
4:23
after I got fired from my job
4:26
and I got in a fight with my boss. And
4:29
- What physical fight?
4:30
- Yeah, we, well, I, I was
4:34
rowdy then, you know,
4:37
and so at a New Year's Eve company party,
4:40
we got pretty drunk and we pushed each other around
4:43
and boom, I decked him and
4:44
you had to to leave.
4:46
Anyway, so that's how I started Bridgewater.
4:49
And because I had clients
4:52
and they wanted to hire me to give them advice,
4:56
- Bridgewater Associates is headquartered in Westport,
4:59
Connecticut. In the mid 1990s
5:02
it had $4 billion of assets under management
5:06
and 90 billion in 2024.
5:09
Bridgewater, like a lot of its closest competitors,
5:12
also made money in the 2008 global market crash.
5:17
Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975
5:21
and ran it for 47 years.
5:24
And only in 2025, nearly half a century
5:27
after he started the company,
5:29
Dalio sold his remaining stock and left the board.
5:35
Hedge funds like Bridgewater are private clubs
5:38
where rich people and big institutions pool their money.
5:43
That pot of cash is then managed by professionals
5:46
who don't just buy and hold.
5:47
They also bet on prices going down
5:50
or borrow money to invest more than they have.
5:53
They can buy anything from stocks and bonds to currencies.
5:56
And like gold
5:58
and oil, hedge funds essentially aim
6:00
to make money even when the market is bad.
6:04
So when you start Bridgewater, it wasn't plain sailing.
6:07
It was a bit of up and down
6:08
and at some point it almost went under.
6:09
- Yes, which was one of the best experiences of my life.
6:13
It changed me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6:15
So this was in the seventies
6:17
and the seventies was a wild period.
6:19
You know, market's wild.
6:20
And so
6:23
what happened in 1979?
6:26
Yeah, Paul Volcker gets appointed
6:29
and tightens monetary policy
6:32
and I calculated that
6:34
American banks had lent much more money
6:36
to foreign countries than those countries were going
6:39
to be able to pay back
6:40
and that we're gonna have a big debt crisis.
6:43
And this was very controversial.
6:46
And then I was brought into a lot of attention.
6:49
Wall Street Week, and then I testified to Congress.
6:53
- It's a great pleasure and a great honor to be able
6:55
to appear before you in examination with what
6:58
is going wrong with our economy.
7:00
The economy is now flat, teetering on the brink of failure.
7:05
I can say with absolute certainty
7:07
that if you look at the liquidity base in the corporations
7:10
and the world as a whole, that there's such a reduced level
7:13
of liquidity that you can't return to an era of stagflation.
7:19
- And I couldn't have been more wrong.
7:23
That was the exact bottom in the stock market.
7:26
And I didn't really understand enough the impact
7:30
of easing and so on.
7:31
So I lost money for me. I lost money for clients.
7:34
I was so broke that I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad
7:39
to take care of my family and so on.
7:42
So it was most painful experience that I could imagine.
7:47
And it was really the best experience for me
7:50
because I really learned humility.
7:53
You know, I started to think of myself.
7:56
How do I know I'm right? It created an open-mindedness.
7:59
I wanted to find the smartest people I could
8:01
who would disagree with me to stress test my thinking.
8:05
- But some people struggle to lead, right,
8:08
they wanna lead by consensus.
8:09
And I dunno whether it's a likeability
8:11
- Problem.
8:12
I think it's think it balance it. That's that.
8:13
That's very true. There's a balance between
8:17
autocratic leadership and democratic leadership.
8:21
I don't believe either of those work. Okay.
8:24
The autocratic leader is the person who believes
8:26
that they have all the answers
8:28
and just follow my instructions.
8:29
And I don't believe that works
8:31
because they don't know enough.
8:33
And also they're not having the people with them.
8:35
I don't think democratic leadership works like you take a
8:38
survey or something.
8:39
And so I believe an idea meritocracy works.
8:42
I I, I had a process of
8:44
what we call believability weighted decision making
8:47
for a variety of reasons.
8:49
We collected a lot of data on people
8:50
and that they each rated each other and so on.
8:53
And we would get a good sense in this area.
8:55
In that area that person's particularly strong. And less so
8:59
- With Dalio at the helm, nearly a quarter
9:03
of all new hires wouldn't make it past the first two years,
9:08
Dalio spearheaded a unique corporate culture
9:11
of radical transparency that is not for everyone.
9:16
Since his departure, Bridgewater has dialed it back.
9:22
As Chief Executive and in life,
9:24
Dalio believes we're all blind in different ways.
9:28
So when he ran Bridgewater, Dalio encouraged his employees
9:31
to give the most honest, open, transparent,
9:35
and brutal critiques of each other.
9:37
Everything had to be out in the open. Under Dalio
9:42
employees used an app called the Dot Collector
9:45
to measure each other's strengths and flaws in real time.
9:49
All the time,
9:51
- The Dot Collector collects these views.
9:54
They simply note the attribute
9:56
and provide a rating from one to 10.
9:59
Different people are always going
10:01
to have different opinions.
10:03
It's given us more effective work
10:05
and it's given us more effective relationships.
10:08
- But radical transparency
10:09
or radical truthfulness can also hurt.
10:12
Have you had had any regrets where you were too transparent
10:15
or too truthful with people close to
10:17
- You?
10:18
It, it can always be a challenge. Yes.
10:19
It depends on the person.
10:21
You, it's almost like touching a nerve,
10:22
what I call it is tough.
10:24
Tough love. It's tough love. Yeah.
10:26
Let's say you have a player on a team. Okay?
10:29
And he's got an issue. Yeah, okay.
10:32
Are you going to let it go or are you gonna deal with it?
10:35
If you're going to have an effective team,
10:37
you have to deal with it.
10:38
Right? So I can't not deal with that.
10:41
- But, but this is the, the concern with leadership, right?
10:43
You also want that person to be confident.
10:45
'cause as soon as you lose that confidence,
10:47
then you no longer have a player. Yes. That's any good.
10:50
- Yes. But that, that you see the confidence
10:52
I learned to get
10:53
- Yeah.
10:54
- Was by knowing my weaknesses
10:56
to gain the open-mindedness, pain.
10:58
- Yeah, - We don't like pain.
11:00
But what happens is, but pain is a messenger.
11:03
It tells you about how the world works
11:05
and it tells you how you should deal
11:07
with the world to be effective.
11:09
- How is that? I mean, how did you think about pay? Was it
11:11
- Important to I think, I think about pay
11:13
as sharing the mission.
11:15
And if we're successful, then we should share that.
11:18
If we're not successful, we'll go through the pain.
11:20
Can we go through the pain together in order to get
11:22
to be successful?
11:23
If it's too transactional, you're gonna have a problem.
11:26
Okay. I want people who will go through the ups
11:28
and downs with me because we have a greater mission.
11:32
I want a community in which you always have the right
11:36
and obligation to make sense of things.
11:38
I want help you all struggle well
11:41
and evolve to get the most out of life.
11:46
- Was it tough leaving Bridgewater?
11:48
- Well, no, it was, it was a change, a big change.
11:53
But it was like watching my kids grow up. Okay.
11:56
For 47 years I was responsible for Bridgewater. Okay.
11:59
To watch the, that next generation, you know
12:03
that you want them to be on their own.
12:05
- I know, but when your kids grow up,
12:06
you still miss them a little bit, don't you?
12:07
- No, I don't have to miss them.
12:09
We could still see and hug each other
12:10
and we can still have conversations about
12:12
how the world works or any of that.
12:15
Right. But the decisions are theirs
12:17
and that's how it should be.
12:20
- The founder of the world's biggest hedge fund, Ray Dalio,
12:24
is putting his efforts into
12:26
what he's calling the planet's most important asset.
12:28
the Ocean
12:31
- Dalio also co-founded the non-profit initiative OceanX
12:34
with his son Mark Dalio.
12:38
In Dalio's next phase of life, he wants
12:40
to help us better understand our oceans, to travel
12:45
and document our unchartered underwater worlds.
12:49
- These are man submersibles.
12:51
They go down a thousand meters, so 3,300 feet.
12:55
And so they unlock the world down there.
12:59
We all the time discover species
13:00
that have never been discovered
13:02
- around the world, - Around every place.
13:04
Almost that we go.
13:05
- You've been in these - Oh yeah, I love them. It
13:06
- Takes three people - And you see species
13:08
as you're going down.
13:12
This is, this is not manned,
13:14
is it? Man, from here, this is not manned.
13:15
- Yeah, - It's called a remote operated vehicle.
13:18
- Yeah. - And it will go down 6,000 meters,
13:21
which is 18,000 feet,
13:23
which will cover 98% of the world's ocean.
13:26
- Mark! Of course you are here.
13:29
I should have known you were, you'd be in Nice.
13:30
I didn't think about that.
13:31
Everything. Oh yeah.
13:32
- I didn't want to interrupt.
13:33
He's an ocean guy. He's an
13:34
- Ocean guy. I know he's an ocean guy.
13:36
On how long did it take to build the ship?
13:40
- About three years From the
13:42
architecture to building it through.
13:43
- Yeah. Is there one thing that you, that you're trying to
13:47
- No one thing.
13:48
There's lots of things we wanna see it all.
13:49
It's trying, understand it, trying to, this is twice the
13:51
size of all earth combined, right.
13:54
Of all land. And it's never been explored.
13:57
- Yeah, but why are you
13:58
frustrated? I mean, you, you seem like,
14:00
- No, I'm excited.
14:01
Okay. I'm excited. It's never been explored.
14:03
Imagine there was a continent that has never been explored
14:07
and with all different species that don't, I mean, wow.
14:10
How exciting. Right? And important. Yeah.
14:12
- What's been the most exciting thing you've
14:13
found so far? Is there something
14:14
like that?
14:16
Probably discovering the giant squid, the first
14:19
and only time that the giant squid has been discovered
14:22
and shown in its media.
14:24
That was maybe millions of people loved that.
14:26
But lots of things
14:29
Yeah. Because historically it was like, you know, the whale
14:30
and the squid, right?
14:31
You heard about these like, that's massive fights.
14:33
- Of course. Down there, a thousand meters,
14:36
all this stuff is going on. It's terrifying. It's so
14:38
- Cool.
14:39
I, I always, you know, I think of tech titans fighting it out.
14:41
Yeah,
14:46
- You gotta go dive
14:51
- You.
14:52
You've never frayed into politics.
14:54
- No. - Why not?
14:56
- I have my, the things I'm doing, my games, my, you know,
14:58
the investing and so on
15:01
and you know, it's just not my thing.
15:03
- You stayed relevant in one way or another
15:04
other leaders maybe either dunno how
15:08
or don't wanna stay relevant.
15:09
Like it's, it's tough, you know,
15:11
when people stop recognizing you after a life in the
15:14
- Spotlight.
15:15
Oh, I think that, that, no, no, no.
15:17
I think that we all are gonna be totally forgotten,
15:21
you know, like that that's if you're working
15:23
to be remembered or to be relevant in the spotlight,
15:26
I don't think that's a good idea.
15:27
I think the question is, are you having what you want?
15:30
You know, are you having impact?
15:32
- So Ray, talk to me about this phase in life.
15:34
What do you enjoy the most?
15:35
- I I'm still addicted to the markets and you know,
15:38
and what's going on. And
15:40
- Do you look at them daily?
15:41
- Oh yeah. All the time. Right. I'm as immersive.
15:45
All of, I'm all of the markets. That's my game.
15:47
I'll do that till I die.
15:48
- Yeah, I mean I've interviewed you for many years
15:51
and actually what always surprised me is
15:52
that it's always simple concepts so
15:54
that people overcomplicate the way the economy works,
15:58
the way the markets work, and you've always boiled it down
16:00
to simple concepts.
16:03
- Yeah. I mean you can lose sight of the fundamentals
16:06
by getting into this complexity.
16:08
You know, anybody can make something complicated.
16:11
Takes a genius to make it simple.
16:13
Then you can get into the details.
16:15
- But why do so few people understand that
16:18
or view the world like you do?
16:19
- I think for two reasons.
16:21
First of all, if you wanna see the patterns, you have
16:23
to see them across countries.
16:25
And then I also think that economists
16:27
and so are not tested in the markets.
16:29
Right.
16:30
You know, it could become theoretical.
16:31
Well, when you have to place bets
16:33
and you have to get the penalties of being wrong
16:37
and the rewards of being right,
16:38
you know the, it's a different thing.
16:42
- Bridgewater is a global macro hedge fund.
16:46
That means it values very high level research about
16:48
macroeconomics forces, including geopolitics,
16:53
global trade and Central Bank policy.
16:57
It's up there with prominent hedge funds
16:59
with macro trading roots like Brevan Howard
17:02
and Rokos Capital Management.
17:05
They make money by spotting inefficiencies
17:08
and dislocations in financial systems
17:11
and reaping the benefits of this chaos.
17:15
Even volatility pays off in the sector.
17:18
And to this day, Ray Dalio thinks big picture.
17:23
- Whenever things are coming along that I had not seen
17:27
before, I really needed
17:29
to understand if they happened in history
17:32
so I could understand the mechanics,
17:34
which is why then I study history.
17:36
- 1929 found the bottom falling out
17:39
of the New York Stock Exchange
17:40
and the panic was on. Overnight
17:42
men of wealth were reduced
17:43
to selling apples on street corners.
17:45
The prosperity boom
17:46
of the twenties had exploded like a giant soap bubble.
17:50
Confidence and courage are the essentials of success
17:55
in carrying out our plan.
17:57
- It was so enlightening.
17:59
I understood the Great Depression
18:01
and I understood the thirties and
18:03
because of that type of research, I was able
18:06
to anticipate the 2008 financial crisis
18:10
and the European debt crisis from 2010 to 2015.
18:16
I wouldn't have if I didn't study that period.
18:20
- But Ray, I find it a amazing,
18:22
because actually the financial system has changed so much.
18:24
There's so much more of it.
18:25
So you think that basically it's patterns
18:27
that human behavior is always human
18:30
- Behavior.
18:31
Well, but there's also a dynamic about debt.
18:32
When, when debt
18:33
and debt service rise relative to your income,
18:37
it's like plaque in the arteries that then begins
18:40
to squeeze out the spending.
18:42
And also because one man's debts
18:44
or another man's assets,
18:46
if those don't give a good real return, they will sell.
18:50
So there's a dynamic that we're facing today in which they,
18:54
that's happening to the government.
18:56
It's squeezing out the debt service.
18:58
- But so Ray, you believe that human nature,
19:00
no matter at which point in history almost repeats itself.
19:04
Right? So it could be civil unrest.
19:06
Well, we talk about populism, that there are patterns
19:08
that you can see over the last like 2000 years.
19:11
- Yes. But that's not just a belief, it's an understanding
19:15
of the cause effect relationships, the mechanics
19:17
that show over repeatedly.
19:20
- Ray, talk to me about the, the five forces
19:21
that you see shaping the world
19:23
- Throughout history.
19:24
These same five forces work together to shape the world.
19:28
The first is the money,
19:31
debt, markets economy force, you know,
19:35
debt increases relative to GDP,
19:36
that whole dynamic. Okay. Money.
19:39
- Yeah. - The second is internal order
19:42
and disorder. Conflict.
19:44
So that what happens is when there are larger wealth gaps
19:47
and values gaps, then there are greater conflicts.
19:51
And that dynamic.
19:52
The third dynamic is geopolitics.
19:56
The international world order. How does it operate?
19:59
So since 1945, for most of it,
20:02
we've been in the United States led multilateral world
20:06
order, now we're having a unilateral world
20:08
order with greater conflict.
20:09
Number four acts of nature, droughts, floods,
20:13
and pandemics have killed more people than wars
20:15
and toppled more orders.
20:17
So that's certainly an, an important influence,
20:20
particularly related to climate.
20:22
And number five, over long periods of time,
20:25
the biggest influence is man's learning, particularly
20:29
of new technologies.
20:31
So these forces interrelate with each other.
20:34
You know, the international creates defense expenditures
20:38
and technologies change everything.
20:40
- But, Ray, all of these are,
20:42
all the five source forces are being disrupted.
20:44
Do you worry that this is even more unsettling than in
20:48
previous cycles?
20:50
- The previous cycles were pretty unsettling.
20:52
You know, if you take the most analogous period,
20:55
I would say we're in a period that's quite like 1937-38.
20:59
You have a, a debt issue. Yeah.
21:02
You have the internal conflicts of wealth and,
21:06
and how things should be run.
21:07
Disorder existed before democracies
21:11
stop being democracies.
21:13
So we're in a period that's very much analogous.
21:16
That's plenty to worry about.
21:17
Of course it can be worse, right?
21:19
Because we now- our power
21:21
to hurt each other's never been greater.
21:23
- I hate asking this
21:24
because I don't like throwing around the world- world war,
21:28
but, you know, could we be close to another World
21:30
- War?
21:31
Well, we're in, we're in wars. Okay?
21:33
There is a financial money war, there's a technology war,
21:38
there's geopolitical wars and there are more military wars.
21:42
And so we have a civil war of some sort,
21:45
which is developing in the United States
21:47
and elsewhere where there are irreconcilable differences.
21:51
- So how do you see it being settled actually?
21:54
Where do you see the US going? Does it get settled? Does it?
21:57
- Well either we will rise above it
22:02
and realize that our common good is going
22:06
to necessitate us dealing with it so that
22:11
what works for most people is gonna work.
22:15
I think that's a little bit idealistic.
22:18
I have to be a practical person.
22:20
And I would say that I think
22:23
that these conflicts will become tests of power
22:27
by each side.
22:30
- But Ray, will it really test institutions
22:33
and will it change America forever?
22:34
What, what the US actually stands for.
22:37
- Of course it's been, it's been changed and,
22:40
and in history we have to recognize that all orders
22:44
have come to an end and then there's a new order
22:47
and there's a challenge.
22:48
So I have a principle.
22:49
If you worry, you don't have to worry.
22:52
And if you don't worry, you need to worry.
22:54
Because if you worry, then you will take care of
22:57
what you're worrying about and you make it not happen.
23:00
And if you don't worry, I, I believe
23:02
that if we don't worry about these things,
23:05
then we have greater risks.
23:07
- Ray, thank you so much for your time today.
23:09
- Thank you.
