## Core Decision Workflows
1. **U.S.–China Power Shift Gauge**
   - Aggregate the eight power metrics into standardized scores (0–100) and present deltas, momentum, and inflection warnings.【F:2023-06-14_Thomas Friedman and Ray Dalio Discuss the Changing World Order.txt†L124-L150】
   - Run scenario toggles (e.g., slower credit growth in China, fiscal shock in the U.S.) and project impact on relative standing over 5–20 year windows.【F:2024-04-11_An Update on Ray Dalio's Views of The Five Big Forces Shaping 2024.txt†L627-L739】
   - Surface risk alerts when debt, inequality, or external conflict markers breach Dalio's stress thresholds.【F:2025-06-25_How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle, Chapter 1.txt†L200-L316】

2. **Socioeconomic and Political Pulse**
   - Maintain a five forces dashboard with leading indicators for debt/monetary excess, internal conflict, external tensions, natural disruptions, and human inventiveness progress.【F:2024-04-11_An Update on Ray Dalio's Views of The Five Big Forces Shaping 2024.txt†L110-L159】【F:2024-04-11_An Update on Ray Dalio's Views of The Five Big Forces Shaping 2024.txt†L493-L620】
   - Provide narrative explanations that tie current data back to Dalio's cycle playbooks (e.g., early deleveraging signals, late-stage empire flags).【F:2025-06-25_How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle, Chapter 1.txt†L200-L316】
   - Capture user inputs (assumptions, confidence, expected timelines) to reinforce reflective decision making.【F:2018-05-21_Principles For Success by Ray Dalio.txt†L980-L1035】

3. **Objective News Interpreter**
   - Ingest curated headlines, assign believability weights based on source expertise and track record, and attach relevant principles for context.【F:2018-05-21_Principles For Success by Ray Dalio.txt†L980-L1035】
   - Map each story to affected forces or power metrics, update dashboards, and output action items or watch points for the user.【F:2024-04-11_An Update on Ray Dalio's Views of The Five Big Forces Shaping 2024.txt†L110-L159】
   - Offer journaling prompts so users log their reactions and future tests, supporting compounding learning.【F:2018-05-21_Principles For Success by Ray Dalio.txt†L980-L1035】

## Analytical Engines
- **Knowledge Retrieval Layer:** Embed transcript excerpts, formulas, and historical case studies for grounding answers and verifying claims.【F:2013-09-22_How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio.txt†L15-L110】
- **Rule & Score Engine:** Compute cycle states, debt burdens, reserve strength, and polarity risk using threshold rules plus simple forward projections.【F:2025-06-25_How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle, Chapter 1.txt†L200-L316】
- **Narrative Composer:** Blend retrieved text, rule outputs, and current data into structured responses with citations, follow-up questions, and recommended next steps.【F:2018-05-21_Principles For Success by Ray Dalio.txt†L980-L1035】
- **Evaluation Harness:** Backtest recommendations against historical scenarios (e.g., 2008 deleveraging, 1970s inflation) to validate heuristics and calibrate confidence scores.【F:2025-06-25_How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle, Chapter 3.txt†L140-L260】

## Delivery Plan
1. **Phase 0 – Corpus Preparation (1–2 sprints)**
   - Clean, chunk, and tag transcripts with principle IDs, cycle stages, and force classifications.
   - Build the initial embedding index and publish the formula/principle catalog for engineering reference.
2. **Phase 1 – Guided Retrieval Chat (2 sprints)**
   - Launch a basic RAG chatbot that answers macro questions with transcript citations and static metric snapshots.
   - Ship journaling templates and believability-weight inputs to habituate reflective decisions.
3. **Phase 2 – Data Fusion & Scoring (3–4 sprints)**
   - Integrate macro data APIs, compute normalized scores for the eight power metrics, and light up dashboard components.
   - Introduce rule-driven alerts for debt cycle stages, internal order stress, and external conflict escalation.
4. **Phase 3 – Proactive Copilot (4+ sprints)**
   - Automate news ingestion, believability weighting, and force tagging; push contextual updates to the chat experience.
   - Add scenario simulators and portfolio stress-testing hooks based on Dalio's crisis playbooks.

## Operating Guardrails
- Always cite transcript or data sources in user-facing outputs to maintain transparency and traceability.【F:2018-05-21_Principles For Success by Ray Dalio.txt†L980-L1035】
- Encourage triangulation by prompting users to seek alternative perspectives or stress tests before acting.【F:2018-05-21_Principles For Success by Ray Dalio.txt†L980-L1035】
- Monitor data freshness, bias in source weighting, and rule accuracy; escalate anomalies or missing feeds promptly.【F:2024-04-11_An Update on Ray Dalio's Views of The Five Big Forces Shaping 2024.txt†L110-L159】

By following this blueprint, the repository evolves into a living knowledge system that channels Dalio's principles into a conflict-aware, data-informed copilot ready to interpret current events and support real-world decision making.【F:2023-06-14_Thomas Friedman and Ray Dalio Discuss the Changing World Order.txt†L124-L179】【F:2025-06-25_How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle, Chapter 1.txt†L200-L316】
