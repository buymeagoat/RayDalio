0:21
chapter 4 part two the archetypical
0:25
sequence leading to Central governments
0:27
and central banks going broke the same
0:30
basic sequence of events that has led
0:32
Central governments and central banks to
0:33
go broke has happened repeatedly
0:36
throughout history and it isn't well
0:38
understood the purpose of this part is
0:40
to describe it so that it is well
0:42
understood in this part I provide a
0:45
template of the typical case and the
0:47
most important reasons for the two major
0:49
types of cases one those in which the
0:52
debt is denominated in currencies that
0:55
the country's Central Bank can print and
0:57
two those in which the debt is Den
1:00
minated in currencies that the Central
1:02
Bank can't print after I make that clear
1:05
in the next part I will review how the
1:07
current big cycle starting in 1944 and
1:10
continuing until now transpired relative
1:13
to the archetypical Timeless and
1:15
Universal template described here
1:18
chapter 4 the archetypical sequence in
1:21
examining 65 major debt crises over the
1:24
last 100 years and in examining more
1:26
closely the 35 cases in which the
1:28
central government and or the central
1:30
bank went broke I believe that I have
1:33
come to understand big debt crises
1:35
pretty well what follows is the
1:37
archetypical process zooming into the
1:40
granular mechanics of what typically
1:42
happens both leading up to Central
1:43
governments and central banks going
1:45
broke and after while I think this
1:48
section is important because it shows
1:50
how the template and actual developments
1:52
have looked in detail if you don't want
1:54
to go into all that detail I suggest you
1:56
read what is in bold and decide if you
1:58
want to dive into the greater detail
2:00
from there but first there is one
2:02
important factor to explain that affects
2:05
how the cases transpire that is between
2:08
cases with hard money versus Fiat money
2:11
hard money versus Fiat money the cases
2:14
I'm about to describe come in two broad
2:16
types that typically behave differently
2:17
in ways that you should understand the
2:20
two big types are the hard currency
2:22
cases and fiat currency cases in brief
2:25
the way the hard currency cases work is
2:27
that the governments have made promises
2:29
to deliver money that they can't print
2:31
EG gold silver or another currency that
2:34
the parties view as relatively hard like
2:37
the dollar throughout history in these
2:40
cases when coming up with these hard
2:42
currencies that they couldn't print to
2:44
pay debts became tough the governments
2:46
have almost always reneged on their
2:48
promises to pay in the currency that
2:50
they couldn't print and the value of
2:52
their money and the debt payments
2:53
denominated in it tumbled At the Moment
2:55
The Promise was broken after they broke
2:58
their promise and haven't gone back back
3:00
to having a hard currency they have what
3:02
is called a Fiat monetary system in
3:05
these cases the currency's value is
3:07
based on the faith and incentives that
3:09
the central banks provide the shift of
3:11
most currencies from being hard to being
3:13
Fiat currencies started on August 15th
3:17
1971 I remember it well because I was
3:19
clarking on the floor of the New York
3:21
Stock Exchange at the time and was
3:23
surprised by it then I studied history
3:25
and found that the exact same thing
3:27
happened in April 1933 and I learned how
3:30
they worked in Fiat monetary systems
3:33
central banks primarily use interest
3:35
rates their ability to monetize debt and
3:38
the tightness of money to provide the
3:40
incentives of lender creditors to lend
3:42
and hold debt assets and throughout
3:45
history they like Central governments
3:47
and Central Bankers operating in hard
3:49
currency regimes have created too much
3:52
debt which are claims that people
3:54
believe they can turn in to get money
3:56
which they expect they can use to buy
3:58
things so are the same typee of credit
4:01
debt Dynamics at work I.E the
4:03
governments create and allow their
4:04
private sectors to create too much debt
4:07
to be paid back which leads to printing
4:09
money to make it easier to pay the debts
4:12
which devalues money and makes the
4:13
prices of things go up except in fiat
4:16
currency cases the devaluations don't
4:19
happen all at once at the moment the
4:21
government breaks its promise to convert
4:23
the paper money into the hard money
4:25
storeold of wealth they happen more
4:27
gradually for example we have seen this
4:30
clearly exemplified in the Bank of
4:32
Japan's policies of aggressively
4:34
monetizing a lot of debt and keeping
4:36
real and nominal interest rates
4:38
extremely low which has resulted in its
4:40
currency and the debt denominated in its
4:42
currency being devalued since the start
4:45
of 2013 the holders of Japanese
4:48
government bonds have lost 60% versus
4:51
gold 45% versus us do debt and 6% in
4:56
domestic purchasing power as average
4:58
inflation was one % the devaluation came
5:02
gradually rather than abruptly because
5:04
the Yen was a fiat currency but it came
5:06
for the same reasons it would have come
5:08
if Japan had a hard currency I.E too
5:11
much debt that needed to be monetized
5:13
that in the charts that I will show you
5:15
throughout this chapter you will see
5:16
three lines the Bold one in the middle
5:19
will show all cases the hard and the
5:21
Fiat currencies combined and the two
5:24
lighter lines will show you what
5:25
happened on average in just the hard
5:27
currency cases and what happened on
5:29
average in just the fiat currency cases
5:32
for Simplicity I will explain the
5:34
dynamic by referring to just the
5:35
aggregate line by the way the big Cycles
5:39
through history have typically included
5:40
currency regimes going back and forth
5:43
between being hard and Fiat because they
5:45
each led to extreme consequences and
5:48
required movements to the opposite the
5:50
hard currency regimes broke down with
5:52
big devaluations because the governments
5:54
couldn't maintain debt growth in line
5:56
with their monetary constraints and the
5:58
Fiat monetary system broke down because
6:01
of the loss of faith in the money debt
6:03
being a safe stor hold of wealth nine
6:06
stages of the final crisis in the
6:08
introduction I summarized the whole
6:10
archetypical debt cycle I am now going
6:13
to focus on the final phase of the big
6:14
debt cycle when the central government
6:17
and the Central Bank both go broke this
6:20
Final Phase typically transpires in nine
6:22
steps while the sequence below is the
6:24
archetypical one there are very big
6:26
variations in what happens and when it
6:28
happens and they don't necessarily
6:30
transpire in the exact sequence I
6:33
describe so the things I am referring to
6:35
here can be viewed as the unhealthy
6:37
things that lead to the crisis and the
6:39
steps that are classically taken to get
6:41
out of the crisis the more of these
6:43
unhealthy things exist the greater the
6:46
risk of a heart attack where the central
6:48
government and the Central Bank go broke
6:50
said differently there are many reasons
6:52
a country goes broke EG chronic
6:55
overspending and debt accumulations
6:57
costly Wars costly sh shocks like
7:00
droughts floods and pandemics some mix
7:02
of these things Etc whatever the cause
7:05
is the below checklist adds up to a risk
7:08
gauge because the more of the unhealthy
7:10
things that exist the higher the
7:11
probability of a debt currency crisis
7:14
here is the sequence of unhealthy
7:16
conditions that typifies the last stages
7:18
of the big debt cycle the private sector
7:21
and government get deeply into debt the
7:24
private sector suffers a debt crisis and
7:27
the central government gets deeper in
7:28
debt to help the private sector the
7:31
central government experiences a debt
7:33
squeeze in which the free market demand
7:35
for its debt falls short of the supply
7:37
of it that creates a debt problem at
7:40
that time there is either a a shift in
7:42
monetary and fiscal policy that brings
7:45
the supply and demand for money and
7:46
credit back into balance or B a
7:49
self-reinforcing net selling of the debt
7:52
which creates a severe debt liquidation
7:54
crisis that runs its course and reduces
7:56
the size of debt and Debt Service levels
7:58
relative to
7:59
incomes big net selling of the debt is
8:02
the big red flag the selling of
8:05
government debt leads to a simultaneous
8:07
a free market-driven tightening of money
8:10
and credit which leads to B weakening of
8:13
the economy C declining savings reserves
8:17
and D downward pressure on the currency
8:20
because this tightening is too harmful
8:21
for the economy the Central Bank
8:23
typically also eases credit and
8:25
experiences a devaluation of the
8:27
currency that state is easy to see in
8:30
the market action via interest rates
8:32
Rising led by long-term Bond rates
8:35
Rising faster than short rates and the
8:38
currency weakening simultaneously when
8:40
there is a debt crisis and interest
8:42
rates can't be lowered EG they hit 0% or
8:45
long rates limit the decline of short
8:47
rates the Central Bank prints creates
8:50
money and buys bonds to try to keep long
8:52
rates down and to ease credit to make it
8:54
easier to service debt it doesn't
8:57
literally print money in doing this it
8:59
essentially borrows reserves from
9:01
commercial banks that it pays a very
9:03
short-term interest rate on which
9:05
creates problems for the central bank if
9:07
this debt selling and interest rate
9:09
Rising continue if the selling continues
9:11
and interest rates continue to rise the
9:14
Central Bank loses money because the
9:16
interest rate that it has to pay on its
9:17
liabilities is greater than the interest
9:20
rate it receives on the debt assets it
9:21
bought when that happens that is notable
9:24
but not a big red flag until the central
9:27
bank has a significant negative net
9:28
worth and is forced to print more money
9:31
to cover the negative cash flow that it
9:33
experiences due to less money coming in
9:35
on its assets then has to go out to
9:37
service its debt liabilities that is a
9:40
big red flag because it signals the
9:41
central bank's death spiral I.E the
9:44
dynamic in which the rising interest
9:46
rates cause problems that creditors see
9:48
that lead them not to hold the debt
9:50
assets which leads to higher interest
9:52
rates or the need to print more money
9:54
which devalues the money which leads to
9:56
more selling of the debt assets and the
9:58
currency and so on that is what I mean
10:01
when I say the Central Bank goes broke I
10:04
call this going broke because the
10:06
Central Bank can't make its debt service
10:08
payments though it doesn't default on
10:10
its debts because it prints money when
10:12
done in large amounts that devalues the
10:15
money and creates inflationary
10:16
recessions or
10:17
depressions debts are restructured and
10:20
devalued when managed in the best
10:22
possible way the government controllers
10:24
of fiscal and monetary policy execute
10:27
what I call a beautiful deleveraging in
10:29
which the deflationary ways of reducing
10:31
debt burdens EG through debt
10:34
restructurings are balanced with the
10:36
inflationary ways of reducing debt
10:38
burdens EG by monetizing them so that
10:42
the deleveraging occurs without having
10:44
unacceptable amounts of either deflation
10:46
or inflation at such times extraordinary
10:49
policies like extraordinary taxes and
10:51
capital controls are commonly imposed
10:54
the deleveraging process inevitably
10:56
reduces the debt burdens and creates the
10:58
return to equilibrium one way or another
11:01
the debt and Debt Service levels are
11:03
brought back in line with the incomes
11:05
that exist to service the debts quite
11:08
often there are inflationary depressions
11:10
so the debt is devalued at the end of
11:12
the cycle government reserves are raised
11:14
through asset sales and a strictly
11:16
enforced transition from a rapidly
11:18
declining currency to a relatively
11:20
stable currency is simultaneously
11:23
achieved by linking the currency to a
11:25
hard currency or a hard asset EG Gold by
11:29
the Central Bank and the central
11:31
government and private sector finances
11:33
being brought back in line to be
11:34
sustainable at the early stage of this
11:37
phase it is imperative that the rewards
11:39
of holding the currency and the debt
11:41
denominated in it and the penalties of
11:43
owing money are great in order to
11:45
reestablish the creditability of the
11:47
money and credit by rewarding the lender
11:49
creditors and penalizing the borrower
11:52
debtors in this phase of the cycle there
11:54
is very tight money and a very high real
11:57
interest rate which is very p painful
11:59
and required for a while if it persists
12:02
the supply and demand for money credit
12:05
debt spending and savings will
12:07
inevitably fall back into line how
12:10
exactly this happens largely depends on
12:12
whether the debt is denominated in a
12:14
currency that the central bank can
12:15
create and whether the debtors and
12:17
creditors are primarily domestic so that
12:20
the central government and the Central
12:22
Bank have more flexibility and control
12:24
over the process if so that makes the
12:27
process less painful and if not it is
12:30
inevitably much more painful also
12:33
whether the currency is a widely used
12:34
Reserve currency matters a lot because
12:37
when it is there will be greater
12:38
marginal inclinations to buy it and the
12:41
debt that it is stored in having said
12:43
that it should be noted that throughout
12:45
history there has been a strong tendency
12:47
for governments with such currencies to
12:49
abuse that privilege by doing more than
12:51
enough borrowing to lose that privilege
12:54
which makes their decline more abrupt
12:55
and painful in the next few chapters I
12:58
will show you all this happening in
13:00
charts the views expressed in this
13:02
article are those of the author Ray Deo
