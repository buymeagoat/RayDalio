0:25
equations warning this chapter gets into debt mechanics including some simple equations that are helpful in
0:31
calculating what is likely to happen related to the limitations of debt I believe this material will be valuable
0:38
for professionals and aspiring professionals and probably beyond the interests of others I suggest that you
0:45
give it a scan to grab the important Concepts and then decide if you want to delve deeper into this material while in
0:51
Chapter 2 I described in words how Central governments and central banks typically get into financial trouble in
0:58
this chapter I will show numbers and equations that can be used to anticipate these financial troubles including a few
1:04
formulaic examples to illustrate how high debt burdens compound and create problems I will start by showing you the
1:12
key drivers of debt sustainability and how they interact before I do I will lay
1:17
out what an unsustainable debt burden is ultimately it's simple an unsustainable
1:23
debt burden exists when the amount of money that comes in is less than the money that goes out either because a the
1:30
amount in storage I.E savings goes down and or B the amount borrowed goes up
1:36
until one runs out of savings and or One can't borrow anymore at which time a debt failure occurs think of this money
1:44
flow as being like a blood flow and think of income statements and balance sheets as the reports that show it a
1:51
healthy condition is when the amount that comes in from earning is equal to or greater than the amount that goes out
1:57
from spending and debts don't build up faster than incomes this isn't to say
2:02
that debt growth is necessarily bad if debts build up but the money borrowed leads to incomes Rising faster than the
2:09
rate of Debt Service Rises that will lead to more money coming in than going out which will be healthy when debts
2:16
grow faster than incomes think of it like plaque building up in the arteries because it reduces the amount of income
2:23
flow that can be used for spending or savings that is because it leads to increased Debt Service payments that red
2:29
reduce the amount of income that can go towards spending if the money flow is constrained too much there is a default
2:36
which is the economic equivalent to a heart attack interest rates matter a lot because they influence the amounts that
2:42
have to be paid a lot they also influence the willingness of lender creditors to hold and buy the debt
2:48
assets and liabilities as Debt Service becomes large relative to the amount of income
2:54
and savings a squeeze develops which is when a debt problem occurs we can
2:59
measure debt burdens in the following ways and we know that as they become high and or rise quickly the risks of
3:05
defaults and or devaluations also become High while there are about 35 indicators
3:11
that I look at to assess debt risks the four most important indicators are one
3:17
debts relative to income as debts get larger relative to incomes all else being equal the debtor will have higher
3:24
interest and rollover payments each year which will increasingly squeeze down the money that is left for other ending
3:30
there are two problems with high debts relative to income one there is a greater risk that the large amount of
3:37
existing debt won't be rolled over by creditors and two it creates higher debt service payments as a percent of income
3:44
which reduces the amount of money that can go to spending all else being equal that brings me to the next measure two
3:52
Debt Service relative to income Debt Service is the amount a deor must pay in interest and principal payments to not
3:59
default on its debts each year as total debt service gets higher and higher
4:04
relative to income it will either squeeze out spending or require more borrowing which will further increase
4:10
Debt Service expenditures as this happens it leads investors to expect credit problems ahead and choose not to
4:16
lend more and or to sell the debt assets they already own which causes credit problems to come about to help estimate
4:24
how debts and Debt Service will build up I look at the rate of interest relative to the rate of income growth three
4:31
nominal interest rates relative to a inflation rates and B nominal income
4:37
growth rates on I.E inflation plus real growth I look at these for two reasons
4:42
they show me how debt and Debt Service are likely to grow relative to incomes for example if someone has debts of 100%
4:50
of income the nominal interest rate is 5% and the nominal income growth rate is
4:55
3% they will owe about 102% of income next year assuming their spending is
5:01
equal to their income they show me how attractive credit conditions are for lenders relative to borrowers if nominal
5:08
interest rates are high relative to nominal growth rates and inflation rates that is an indicator that conditions are
5:14
relatively favorable for lenders and unfavorable for borrowers which will encourage lending and discourage
5:20
borrowing spending I.E it reflects greater risk of debt problems among more
5:26
indebted debtors that can't print money to pay debt if the reverse is true
5:31
conditions are relatively unfavorable for lender creditors and favorable for borrower debtors which will encourage
5:37
borrowing and discourage lending four debts and Debt Service relative to
5:43
savings EG reserves if all of the above are not financially healthy but one has
5:49
large savings to draw on and draw down one won't have a high risk of default
5:54
because one can draw on the savings EG reserves to make debt and spending payments
6:00
inevitably equilibrium levels of one debts relative to incomes two Debt
6:05
Service relative to incomes three nominal interest rates relative to inflation rates I.E real interest rates
6:13
and nominal growth rates and four debts and Debt Service relative to savings will be approached if you watch these
6:20
ratios over time you will see them go to extreme levels and return to more normal levels one way or another if you
6:27
understand the cause effect relationships that drive these changes you can understand how to navigate them
6:32
and how they can be best managed most importantly if you understand the painful deleveraging part you will
6:39
understand that it can be handled well to be less painful or handled poorly and be very painful these four indicators
6:46
are not the only ones that matter in chapter 4 I'll show you how a broader set of indicators evolve through the end
6:53
of the big debt cycle and in chapter 15 I'll show you what my indicators suggest for the us today
7:00
however the previously mentioned four are the most important ones to watch they give us valuable information about
7:06
How likely a debt squeeze is and how severe it will be when it happens however they cannot tell us exactly when
7:12
the debt problem will occur because different conditions and different people's reactions to them lead to
7:18
different lead times for the selling of debt assets and other actions that precipitate a crisis still we can
7:24
measure the level of risk because countries with very high debt levels very large deficit low savings and very
7:31
high and very fast rising interest rates have a very high risk of a debt default or debt devaluation crisis the rest of
7:39
this section goes through a few formulaic examples to illustrate how high debt burdens compound and create
7:45
problems measuring debt burdens in numbers what follows are the mathematical relationships for measuring
7:52
these indicators these are just the common sense constraints on the amount of debt an entity can have expressed in
7:59
in equations which are the same constraints that you can have expressed in words to help you understand them you
8:05
might relate to them the same way you relate to your own debt constraints I will explain the rules and include a few
8:11
helpful rules of thumb the pages that follow will explain each of these with examples not only can these
8:18
relationships help one to identify debt problems but they can be used to help policy makers see how to fix them and
8:24
help Market participants position themselves well feel free to skip the this and come back if it's more helpful
8:31
to see examples first and then the math one future debts relative to future
8:37
income the formula to estimate this is in words future debt relative to revenue
8:43
is a function of one spending more or less than one makes in Revenue two the
8:48
compounding of one's existing debts and three Revenue growth as one's expenses
8:53
grow relative to one's Revenue one is forced to borrow more to finance the spending which increases new new
8:59
borrowing first numerator term as interest rates rise existing debts grow
9:05
faster second numerator term as revenues grow incomes grow relative to debts so
9:11
the ratio of debt to revenue Falls denominator term debt income is a good
9:16
indicator of risk because the larger it is the riskier and the more burdensome the debt is all else being equal for
9:24
example the more debt there is the more risk there is that the debt won't be rolled over and the more difficult it is for the
9:31
central bank to keep interest rates low enough to satisfy the borrower debtors without having them too high for the
9:37
lender creditor you can probably already see that in addition to the level of debt income mattering the interest rate
9:44
income growth rate and primary deficit expenses excluding interest versus Revenue matter a lot to how debt burdens
9:52
evolve we can also reconfigure this formula to solve for ways to keep the debt to income ratio the same we will
9:59
show a few different examples of this at the end of this chapter two future Debt
10:04
Service relative to future income the formula to estimate this is in words
10:10
future Debt Service relative to revenue is a function of future interest costs and principle payments relative to how
10:17
much revenue grows if Revenue grows a lot Debt Service will fall relative to
10:22
incomes all else equal future interest costs are a function of the debt level
10:27
and the average interest rate on debt if interest rates shoot up it generally will not immediately make the interest
10:34
costs for a debtor go up because on their longer term bonds the interest rate will be locked at the interest rate
10:40
at the time of issuance as the bonds roll I.E come due and are reissued at
10:45
the new interest rate the bonds will gradually get to have higher interest rates on them and interest costs will
10:51
rise principal payments are the amount of debt that is coming due each year that must be paid back typically via
10:58
issuing new debt to pay back the old debt that comes due a rough way to estimate principal payments is by
11:05
calculating the average maturity or time until debts must be paid back on
11:10
existing debts when debt is are stressed creditors typically will not want to lend to them for as long so we often see
11:17
the maturity of debts falling as creditors become more stressed which means principal payments go up for the
11:23
same level of debts three nominal interest rates relative to a inflation
11:29
rates and B nominal income growth rates I.E inflation plus real growth the
11:36
expected level of nominal interest rates relative to nominal growth rates tells us how debt and Debt Service is likely
11:42
to grow or Shrink below we show the formula for the interest rate that would keep debt levels and interest Debt
11:48
Service flat relative to revenue note that this is based on the first Formula
11:53
just reconfiguring that formula to give us the required interest rate to keep debts flat relative to Revenue to walk
12:00
through this in words if the primary deficit is zero I.E current expenses
12:06
before interest cause current Revenue debts will stay flat if the interest
12:11
rate is equal to the revenue growth rate if the primary deficit is 5% of the
12:16
current debt level interest rates would need to be 5% below the revenue growth rate the intuition here is that if the
12:24
interest rates are equal to revenue growth debts will compound at the same rate that income is growing
12:30
if the government is also borrowing debts need to compound slower than income so interest rates need to be
12:35
below Revenue growth rates as interest rates rise relative to revenue growth rates debts will grow relative to
12:42
incomes because existing debts will compound faster than revenue is growing and interest debt service costs will
12:48
grow even faster because both the debt level will grow and the interest rate will be rising and interest costs are
12:54
the product of these two inputs similarly as interest rates fall debt levels will grow less quickly and
13:01
interest debt service costs will grow even less or Shrink this is for instance
13:06
what has happened in Japan over the last 20 years I will show this in more detail in chapter 14 you can probably see that
13:14
just as you can solve for the interest rate required to keep debts flat you can also solve for the deficit or Surplus
13:20
required Revenue growth required and so on if you flip to the end of this chapter I show you what these numbers
13:27
look like for the US and Japan today for debts and Debt Service relative to
13:32
savings EG reserves just as we can estimate debt burdens relative to income
13:38
we can estimate them relative to savings simply by looking at the level and change in savings rather than the level
13:45
and change in incomes the formula to estimate this is as follows these
13:50
formulas are very similar to 1 and two so I will not fully walk through them in words the difference is that we are
13:57
looking at debts and Debt Service relative to savings if one has large debts but very large savings it is less
14:04
likely that the debt burdens are concerning because one can pay the debt service and pay back part of the debts
14:10
using the savings it creates a buffer if one is consistently running deficits and
14:15
the expected Surplus is negative you can see that debts and Debt Service will quickly grow relative to savings
14:21
creating a more concerning setup a few rules of thumb that help to convey how these equations play out if nominal
14:29
interest rates are at the same level as nominal income growth and a government is running no primary deficit IE Revenue
14:37
our spending excluding interest the debts will stay the same relative to the
14:42
incomes but if interest rates are higher than income growth then the debt burdens of existing debts will increase this is
14:50
probably the single most important variable in our calculation for example a bad but plausible period of nominal
14:57
interest rates to nominal growth would be interest rates being higher than income growth by 2% this would cause the
15:04
debt to income ratio to increase by around 50% over 20 years even without
15:09
primary deficits leading to more borrowing and debt this means that if you start with debts of 50% of income
15:16
they'll go to 75% but if you start with debts of 400% they'll go to
15:22
600% Debt Service expenses accumulating is like plaque in the arteries accumulating in that it squeezes out the
15:29
desired flow of nutrients to the economy the main effect of high debt levels is making the DEA vulnerable to not being
15:36
able to roll it forward these mathematical relationships can provide us with good estimates of the magnitudes
15:42
of Debt Service squeezes that will occur if the existing levels of debt are rolled over however they don't show the
15:49
dynamic that happens when holders of debt assets want to sell the debt they are holding in this next section I will
15:55
explain all these things now I will go through a few examples to illustrate how
16:00
these drivers work and interact with one another example one debts relative to
16:06
incomes levels and changes as starting debt levels grow and as deficits I.E
16:12
borrowings grow future debt levels Debt Service and interest costs all grow the
16:18
table below shows a range of outcomes the debt to GDP ratio which is more commonly quoted is not as relevant to
16:25
the government's Debt Service picture as its own debt to income ratio that is because for any deta including
16:32
Central governments what matters most is the amount of money that goes out in this case in debt service relative to
16:39
the amount of money that comes in because that is what creates the debt squeeze the size of GDP is only
16:45
partially related both are only rough indicators of the capacity of the economy to Bear the debt burden for
16:52
reference the US government's debt to money coming in mostly tax income is as
16:57
of this writing about 580 expenditures excluding interest are
17:03
projected to average shika 115% of income over the next decade so the
17:08
primary deficit the difference between these is 15% of income the US is also
17:14
borrowing 20% of its income each year to cover interest expenses on the existing
17:20
debt if we assume that interest rates equal income growth but use the actual projected primary deficit for the US I.E
17:27
the actual Gap between non-interest expenses and income the US government's debt to income is projected to rise by
17:34
about 150% from 580 to 730% over the next 10
17:41
years this would also lead to a proportional increase in the interest expense and Debt Service burden the
17:47
table below shows debt levels 10 years forward for various starting debt levels and deficits the second table shows the
17:55
change relative to the starting debt level you can see that as as the starting debt level rises and as
18:01
deficits become larger the expected debt level at the end gets higher when going through these numbers you might keep in
18:07
mind that at the time of this writing the US Japanese Chinese French German
18:12
and UK numbers are approximately as follows example two the effects of
18:18
nominal interest rates minus nominal income growth rates on debt to income ratios when interest rates are higher
18:25
than income growth rates the existing debt grows relative to incomes because the debt compounds faster than incomes
18:32
grow the tables below illustrate how this works previously we showed how debt
18:37
grows for different starting debt levels and deficits this time we are assuming a starting deficit of 35% of income using
18:45
the cbo's projected primary deficit over the next decade the rows below are still
18:50
different starting debt levels The Columns now show the nominal interest rate minus the nominal income growth
18:57
rate the CBO projects that over the next decade effective interest rates will
19:02
average 3.4% and the us will have 3.8% nominal growth the difference is
19:09
0.4% so this would leave the us around the red boxed area below the first table
19:15
below shows the levels of debt to income 10 years from now based on these assumptions and the second table shows
19:21
the change in debt to income over the 10 years as interest rates get higher than
19:26
growth debt levels grow faster also as debts get higher the impact of high
19:31
interest rates gets worse much faster previously we forecast that with current debts and deficits US debt levels will
19:38
rise from 580 to 730% of income if we also incorporate projected interest
19:45
rates relative to nominal growth we'd expect us debt levels to rise to 679 of
19:51
income assuming taxes stay a constant share of GDP you get the idea since
19:57
interest rates are projected to be slightly below nominal growth this adjustment doesn't change our debt
20:03
Outlook much for the us today but you can see that if the Central Bank wanted to help the central government keep its
20:09
debt burdens more manageable it could push interest rates to further below nominal growth by buying the government
20:15
bonds which would cause debt burdens to grow much slower all else equal of
20:21
course that wouldn't be good for the lender creditors holding the debt assets because they would get a lower nominal
20:26
interest rate and a lower real interest rate than they would have gotten I suspect that you are beginning to get
20:31
the picture of how this Dynamic works and has worked in the past EG why
20:37
central banks created such low nominal rates near 0% and such negative real
20:42
interest rates by printing money and buying government debt and what is most likely to take place in the future if
20:48
the current path isn't altered more specifically if debt growth remains as projected central banks will have to
20:55
push real interest rates lower which will make debt assets less attractive for lender
21:00
creditors in an economy there are many interrelated drivers that change interdependently it's like a Rubik's
21:07
Cube in which changing one part of the cube One driver in the grids shown previously causes changes to the other
21:14
parts it gets complicated to understand how these drivers interrelate and to project scenarios to help illustrate
21:21
this we created a simple model to walk through one scenario for the next decade let's start by considering examples
21:28
three below with a government that has numbers similar to the US government now let's say nominal income is growing at
21:35
3.8% a year interest rates are 3.4% and debt levels start at 580 of government
21:43
income in this example we'll assume that the government spends 35% more than it
21:48
collects in income including interest payments example three interest rates
21:54
spiral upward to keep buyers in the debt assets since this government is running
21:59
a 15% primary deficit I.E excluding interest payments it collects 5.2
22:05
trillion in revenue and spend $6 trillion in year one it must pay $1.1
22:11
trillion in interest because it started with debts at 580 of government income
22:16
and interest rates are about 4% let's assume that about 35% of the existing
22:22
debt is coming due this year which is about how much US Government debt matures every year and will need to be
22:29
rolled over so 10.3 trillion Do's existing debt will come due this year
22:34
and will need to be paid back in total this government needs to sell $12.2 trillion of debt in year One what
22:41
happens if the public is no longer willing to buy this debt or is a seller at current interest rates markets must
22:48
clear so this means that interest rates will go up until someone is willing to buy these bonds but as the interest
22:55
rates go up that makes the government's borrowing even more expensive meaning the problems get even worse creating a
23:01
greater desire to sell the bonds which creates even more upward pressure on interest rates a spiral of rising
23:08
interest rates leading to worsening credit risk leading to less demand for the debt leading to higher interest
23:14
rates is a classic debt death spiral in the table below you can see how this works in this example I show interest
23:22
rates going up by 0.5% a year while nominal growth stays flat if interest
23:27
rates stayed flat that the government would have ended year 10 with debts at 679 of income and interest at 22% of
23:35
income here relative to income we end with debts at 8.98% interest at 68% and
23:42
total debt service including principal payments of 353 c. of course if interest
23:48
rates are going up because the debts are unsustainable they'll only go up more as debts rise and become even more
23:54
unsustainable and at the same time the high interest rates are likely constricting income growth increasing
24:00
the challenge of debt sustainability of course the worst case scenario is one where a significant
24:06
additional amount of debt assets is sold I.E to fund a war or social benefits in
24:11
a recession which would drive interest rates up a lot more a toy model interest
24:17
rates spiral higher a government can prevent this spiral of rising rates by reducing its debt burdens I laid this
24:24
out in more detail in my book principles for navigating big debt Crim es but to reiterate there are four ways to reduce
24:31
debt burdens for a government austerity I.E spending less which doesn't work
24:37
because one person's spending is another's person's earnings so austerity causes a self-reinforcing deflationary
24:44
contraction debt defaults restructurings which reduce debt burdens and are
24:49
deflationary because one person's debts are another's assets the Central Bank printing money and making purchases of
24:56
debt which reduces debt burdens because it provides the money to pay the debts and is inflationary transfers of money
25:03
and credit from private Market players who have money to the government via taxes which is then transferred to other
25:09
private Market players when I looked at historical cases of private debt problems I typically saw a mix of these
25:15
levers being pulled with a strong bias to print money and buy debt I.E monetize
25:21
debt when the debt squeeze is big I also saw the fight over increased taxes as
25:26
well as big conflicts between those of the left and those of the right that all occurs for logical reasons when Central
25:33
governments are squeezed it's a big deal because Central governments are typically the largest part of the
25:38
economy and the only part of the economy to pay for large amounts of non-economic social expenses which are critically
25:45
important at such times when economic conditions are bad if governments are slow in providing spending and financial
25:52
support it's likely that that will create a larger economic downturn which counterintuitively worsen debt burdens
25:59
by reducing income growth and net worths and could lead to social turmoil as a result for overly indebted
26:06
governments to cut their spending to deal with their debt problems at such times is self- damagingly painful then
26:12
the question is where does the government get its money from the easiest path though not the best path
26:18
for the long-term health of the system is for governments to resolve their debt problems and spend as they would like to
26:24
spend by having the Central Bank print money and purchase the bonds thereby holding interest rates down at
26:30
tolerable levels and putting money into the system as a result that is what they will unfailingly do when the debts are
26:38
denominated in their own currencies let's look at an example of how this works example four Central Bank steps in
26:46
because private players are unwilling to hold the desired amount of government bonds to keep interest rates at the
26:51
desired level for acceptable economic growth thus far we looked at how the starting debt to income ratio the income
26:58
growth rate the spending growth rate the interest rate and the maturity of the government debt affects future debt
27:06
burdens also as mentioned the demand for the debt matters a lot and the central
27:11
bank can and typically does print money and buy I.E monetized debt let's now
27:17
look at how this last piece works there are many factors that determine the private markets demand for government
27:23
debt as previously explained these include the expected real return of bonds relative to the projected real
27:30
returns of other assets the total amount of money and Credit in the system the sense of impending risk of a debt
27:36
currency crisis Etc while these factors are measurable they are much harder to project than the previously described
27:44
determinants however they are observable most importantly in the form of either a interest rates going up while the
27:51
economy and the currency are weak due to the supply demand imbalance worsening or
27:56
B central banks spending reserves and or printing money and creating debt to buy government debt to try to lower real and
28:03
nominal interest rates by increasing the demand to eliminate the imbalance in the next chapter you will see how this
28:10
typically happens and signals for the transition to the debt currency crisis
28:15
before we move on I wanted to show you how it works for the central bank to step in and absorb excess debt Supply in
28:21
order to maintain interest rates and liquidity at a desired level let's start with our previous example and model
28:28
modify it slightly let's assume that in year 1 the government has $10.3 trillion
28:33
of debt expiring and is issuing $ 122 trillion of new debt to replace the expiring bonds pay interest and cover
28:41
spending rather than allowing interest rates to spiral upward to generate sufficient demand for these debt assets
28:47
let's assume the Central Bank steps in and buys all the excess issuance so that the private sector continues to hold no
28:54
more than 600% of government income in debt and interest rates stay flat at
29:00
3.4% in this example in year two the central bank will have to buy 0.3
29:06
trillion of those debt Assets in subsequent years these purchases get larger and larger mechanically to
29:13
purchase these debt assets I.E monetize the government debt the Central Bank
29:18
prints money by creating new reserves cash and gives private players that money in exchange for the bonds this
29:26
increases the money supply m Z in this example let's assume that the money supply starts at $5.6 trillion so 110%
29:35
of the starting government income roughly where it is today in the United States in our example as the Central
29:42
Bank prints more and more to cover government shortfalls the money supply balloons the Central Bank steps in this
29:50
is a rough example but you can see the general Contours of how this works for real economies as an economy needs lower
29:57
and lower interest rates Ates to keep debt burdens manageable there is less and less private demand for the debt at
30:03
those lower interest rates which requires the central bank to step in the more the Central Bank steps in the more
30:09
it is forced to increase the money supply which devalues money and makes holding debt less desirable that is
30:15
because all else being equal central bank money and credit creation lowers the value of money which increases
30:22
inflation and currency weakness the relationship is not precise and depends on how exactly the printed money is
30:29
transmitted through the economy lowering interest rates and increasing the supply of money lowers the attractiveness of
30:35
the currency which makes holding the debt denominated in that currency unattractive in the tables below I
30:42
wanted to give you a sense of how much money gets printed and how it affects the currency in the first table the rows
30:49
represent different starting debt to income levels for a government and the columns represent how many bonds private
30:55
players are willing to purchase at current interest rates as a government has more of a debt problem and as
31:01
private players are willing to hold less of the debt the money stock increases more the Red Box reflects the scenario
31:08
laid out above where the Central Bank buys $7.7 trillion of bonds increasing
31:14
the money stock from $5.6 trillion to 13.5 trillion buying up bonds and increasing
31:22
the money supply is stimulative and puts downward pressure on the currency in two ways mechanically pushing down interest
31:29
rates usually causes the currency to sell off why to spell out the mechanics
31:35
usually all else equal lowering an interest rate won't change investors long-term expectations of the value of a
31:42
currency the 10-year forward currency doesn't move as much if you are getting less interest in the meantime because
31:48
interest rates fell the New Deal is strictly worse the way to make the New Deal Fair again is for the spot currency
31:55
to fall that way you'll earn more more through currency appreciation as it reaches the same expected 10-year
32:02
forward point to make up for Less in interest my next point will be too technical for some and helpfully
32:08
Technical for others so if you want to skip the technical stuff skip it mechanically pushing down interest rates
32:15
pushes up the currency forward eg a rise in one country's 10year Sovereign
32:20
risk-free bond yield relative to another country's 10-year risk-free bond yield will raise the 10year forward currency
32:27
so if the value to investors of the currency in the 10-year future were to stay the same the spot currency would
32:33
have to sell off by the present value of the 10-year interest rate differences to keep the 10-year currency forward flat
32:40
said more precisely and more simply as explained in chapter one the difference in Sovereign interest rates in two
32:46
countries will be offset by the forward currency premium EG if the interest rate
32:51
in country a is 2% above the interest rate in country B then the forward currency of country a will be at a 2%
32:59
per year annual discount to Country B so if interest rates in country a were lowered by 1% from that level and the
33:06
forward currency stays the same the currency would weaken by a corresponding amount also the printed money can
33:12
directly flow out of the currency creating a selling pressure in the currency that is as a central bank buys
33:18
bonds and gives other players cash there is a chance that they use that cash to buy other currencies rather than holding
33:25
it or buying assets just spending in the same economy in the next table we show a
33:30
range of outcomes for how this might work the columns again reflect different willingness to lend by private players
33:37
as you go to the right private players are less willing to lend to the government the rows reflect how
33:42
sensitive the currency is to the money supply as the market sees a currency as a worse and worse store of value we'd
33:50
expect the currency to become more sensitive to the money supply because other players will be less willing to
33:55
hold it for example let's assume that printing 1% of GDP in money led to V 1%
34:01
currency weakness then in the example above we'd expect a humon 15% currency
34:07
depreciation as the currency becomes more sensitive to the amount of money I.E m0 and as the private sector becomes
34:14
less willing to lend we'd expect to see more and more currency weakness what level of interest rates can make debt
34:21
burdens affordable for a country in these examples we looked at how debts can compound to become unsain
34:27
sustainable I also wanted to show you the numbers around how debts can be managed sustainably in countries that
34:34
have a lot of debt and high deficits debts and debt service costs will be a big issue and how much they will
34:40
increase over time will be determined by the interest rate relative to income growth and inflation as shown in our
34:47
calculations a central bank can prevent debt service costs from rising or cause them to decrease relative to inflation
34:54
and incomes by pushing down nominal interest rates below nominal growth rates what I am referring to are the
35:00
impacts these things will have on the central governments and the central bank's Financial conditions of course
35:07
they will also have a ripple effect on all parts of the economy but let's skip that for now given that we can look at a
35:13
government's debt level and projected deficit and calculate what interest rate will be needed to produce any specified
35:19
level of debt and Debt Service relative to incomes EG to keep the debt burden
35:25
the same to have it decline Etc given estimates of future revenue and expenses
35:31
if I were setting policy for the FED I would want to look at what the deficit and debt levels are and likely will be
35:37
and set an interest rate so that debt burdens won't become too great over time for example I would probably want to
35:44
look at what interest rate would keep Debt Service payments the same that would affect my interest rate policy I
35:51
would also want to calculate what level of interest rate would be needed for my Central Bank not to have big losses on
35:57
my my balance sheet let's look at these things and also look at how they would have worked in the past formula for
36:04
determining future debt burdens as a reminder the equation below shows the drivers of future levels of
36:10
debt and Debt Service relative to incomes this is more fully explained at the start of this chapter in the table
36:18
below I use this formula to estimate what interest rates would stabilize debt burdens relative to incomes for the us
36:24
today we also show how each of the other available levers would have to change in order to stabilize debt burdens you can
36:32
see that to stabilize government debt burdens the US would either need to see nominal interest fall to about 1% see
36:39
nominal economic growth average about 6% 2.5% additional inflation above the 3.8%
36:47
nominal growth projected by the CBO or raise government revenue I.E raising
36:53
taxes by 11% of course each one of these part s would be intolerably too large so it
37:00
will take the right combination of lesser amounts of these to successfully achieve the goal in chapter 16 my 3%
37:07
solution how the us could stabilize its debt burden I show what I believe the
37:13
best combinations would be to achieve the goal of limiting debt burdens and risks in a very tolerable way the views

World Order I'm measured and looked at the most important cause chock effect relationships that changed the world
42:02
over the last 500 years and simplified my description of how I see them to consist of the five big forces typically
42:09
35 55% of all spending if you include state and local governments in developed
42:15
countries comes from government spending Bitcoin is an example of an attempt to create a private version of money using
42:22
blockchain a distributed Ledger technology while it's by and large true
42:27
that all Investments compete on just a total return basis it's not totally true
42:32
because different investors have different objectives and considerations so that at sometimes these different
42:37
objectives and the differences in the supplies of Investments to meet the demands can lead to some Investments
42:43
having more attractive returns than others however because there is a profit to be made by shorting the asset that
42:50
has the lower risk adjusted return to fund the one that has the higher risk adjusted return there is a strong
42:57
tendency for these differences to shrink to be rather small I can make money by buying an
43:03
investment that has a higher total return while selling an investment that has a lower total return for example for
43:10
items that can be stored the price premium of the forward or Futures price over the spot price won't be more than
43:16
the cost of storing it including the interest expense on the money tied up with it in inventory for items that will
43:23
be stored EG gold the spot price will be detered determined by the expected future price minus the storage cost
43:31
rather than the future price being determined by the spot price plus the storage cost here's the math if a
43:37
currency is expected to depreciate by 2% per year that means the forward price is
43:43
82% of the current price 2% depreciation compounded for 10 years the spot needs
43:49
to be priced to appreciate by 3% each year until it reaches the current 10-year forward price of 82% a spot
43:56
price of 0.61 X 1.03 Ola 10
44:02
0.82 so the spot Must Fall from 1 to 0.61 which is a 40% move here's the
44:09
somewhat simpler math the price impact of an interest rate move on bonds is the change in yield X the duration the
44:17
duration of 10-year government bonds is 7 to 8 years depending on the country 8X
44:23
5% 40% entity from a Central Bankers perspective the currency weakness and
44:29
inflation can be good because they reduce the debt burden which happens when the nominal interest rate is below
44:35
the nominal growth rate and especially when the nominal interest rate is below the inflation rate I.E when real
44:42
interest rates are negative 10 keep in mind that the different inflation rates in the different countries are typically
44:48
more due to the differences in the rates of changes in the values of their money currencies which are more due to the
44:55
changing supplies of money and credit credit then they are due to the changing values of the items being bought and
45:01
sold when measured in a common currency for Simplicity I am using the
45:06
word Banks to describe all Financial intermediaries that take on financial liabilities to get higher returns in
45:13
financial assets if the amount earned is greater than the amount spent excluding
45:18
the interest payments that is called a primary Surplus and if it is less that is called a primary deficit this
45:26
equation is inexact act because a government could use a surplus to either accumulate reserves savings or to pay
45:32
down existing debts which would show up via expenses being lower than Revenue
45:38
depending on what choice a government made the Surplus could show up as future debt falling or as future savings
45:44
increasing either way the ratio would improve but the effect would be slightly different based on the choices of the
45:50
government 14 GDP can be an indicator of the size of the economy that can be taxed by governments to make debt
45:57
payments so throughout this study I am using the cbo's projections where
46:02
possible as a baseline estimate these projections are based on settled law so they assume that expiring fiscal
46:08
measures I.E the Trump tax cuts roll off as implemented in current law if these
46:14
tax cuts are extended the CBO estimates it would represent additional annual spending of 1.3% of GDP or 10.6% of
46:23
government revenue which would substantially worsen the fiscal trajectory versus the cbo's Baseline
46:30
projection 16 as noted previously the CBO projections use settled law so they
46:35
assume that expiring fiscal measures I.E the Trump tax cuts roll off as
46:41
implemented in current law if these tax cuts are extended the CBO estimates it
46:46
would represent additional annual spending of 1.3% of GDP or 10.6% of
46:52
government revenue the views expressed in this article are those of the author Ray Dario
