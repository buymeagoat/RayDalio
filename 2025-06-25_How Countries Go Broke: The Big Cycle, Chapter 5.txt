5 chapter five the private sector and
0:25
central government debt crisis stages 1
0:28
4 in chap 4 I laid out the archetypical
0:32
sequence that you see across crises now
0:34
I go into much more detail on each phase
0:37
showing the specific markers and
0:39
Dynamics I saw when I looked at
0:40
historical cases I will show this
0:43
dynamic in charts accompanied by brief
0:45
explanations in the charts the dark blue
0:48
line shows the average of all cases The
0:50
Thin Red Line shows the average of the
0:52
fixed exchange rate cases and the thin
0:55
Green Line shows the average of Fiat
0:57
variable exchange rate cases you will
0:59
know that the timing and the
1:01
distinctiveness of these events is
1:02
clearer in the cases in which exchange
1:04
rates are fixed in which case they more
1:06
cleanly intensify and then break than in
1:09
the fiat currency cases in which the
1:11
adjustments are more fluid that is
1:14
because in fixed rate cases you can see
1:16
the pressures build up until there is a
1:18
clear break whereas in the variable
1:20
exchange rate cases you will see these
1:22
changes occur more
1:24
gradually stage one the private sector
1:27
and government get deep in debt we we
1:30
see this in classic ways such as in the
1:33
years before the crisis the government
1:35
classically has a large and growing
1:36
stock of debt as a result of chronic
1:39
deficit spending typically one sees a
1:41
rising share of spending going to
1:44
consumption social safety net and a
1:46
declining share going to productivity
1:48
enhancing investment causing debts to
1:51
increase without a commensurate increase
1:53
in incomes typically countries become so
1:56
reliant on a large social safety net
1:59
that cutting becomes a political third
2:01
rail EG in Brazil today the us today the
2:05
level of debt is typically High relative
2:07
to the government's ability to pay it
2:09
back with tax revenues and The Debt
2:11
Service burden is also High relative to
2:14
the government's incomes starting to
2:16
crowd out spending on other line items
2:18
that are considered essential to cover
2:20
these costs more debt needs to be sold
2:23
than the private sector wants to buy a
2:25
source of upward pressure on interest
2:27
rates further increasing Debt Service
2:30
costs note the big differences in what
2:32
happens in these cases between the
2:34
floating rate currencies and the fixed
2:36
rate currencies after the big default
2:38
chart devaluation moment it reflects the
2:41
fact that in the fixed exchange rate
2:43
cases the debt restructuring is more
2:45
severe and definitive which sets the
2:47
stage for a more abrupt and larger
2:49
rebound Fiat cases see a gradual
2:52
increase in debt as money printing from
2:54
the Central Bank allows government
2:56
spending to continue or even accelerate
2:59
please note that the numbers in the
3:00
xaxis represent months before and after
3:03
the peak of the crisis the charts below
3:06
show the typical amount of government
3:08
borrowing in total and excluding
3:10
borrowing to cover interest payments
3:12
that was done in the Years leading up to
3:14
the
3:15
devaluation in 31 of the 35 cases we
3:18
studied we saw large persistent
3:20
government deficits going into the
3:22
crisis it's worth noting that sometimes
3:25
the public sector balance sheet looks
3:27
less problematic on its face this is
3:30
true when there is heavy borrowing in
3:31
the private sector that the public
3:33
sector has to back up and when there are
3:35
implicit public sector guarantees to
3:38
back stop institutions such as banks
3:40
that the government can't afford to let
3:42
fail such cases might as well be public
3:45
sector balance sheet
3:47
problems the buildup of debts requires
3:49
large lending from foreigners to finance
3:51
them that lending can be in borrowing
3:54
the country's currency which increases
3:56
the risk of devaluation or a reserve
3:59
currency which increases the risk of
4:01
default this increases the country's
4:03
vulnerability to a pullback in foreign
4:06
Capital having said that having a
4:08
current account deficit doesn't
4:10
necessarily signal problems it reflects
4:13
Capital coming into the country which
4:15
could be indicative of the
4:16
attractiveness of the country's capital
4:18
markets however in circumstances in
4:21
which the attractiveness of the
4:22
country's capital markets gets impaired
4:24
by the need to issue a lot of debt and
4:26
money quickly to deal with a crisis the
4:29
potential for foreign selling of the
4:30
country's currency and debt represents
4:33
an added source of vulnerability as
4:35
shown in the next set of charts steadily
4:38
increasing current account and twin
4:40
deficits typically lead the crisis by
4:42
several years when the crisis occurs it
4:45
takes the form of a big devaluation and
4:47
a constriction of debt Finance demand
4:50
including for imports which has the
4:53
effect of reducing these deficits years
4:55
of large borrowing from foreigners
4:57
results in a substantial accumulating
4:59
debt to foreigners which increases the
5:02
country's vulnerability to a pullback in
5:04
foreign Capital the charts Below on the
5:07
left show the total net International
5:09
Investment position assets owned abroad
5:12
minus liabilities owed to the rest of
5:14
the world and an adjusted version on the
5:17
right that measures the amount of liquid
5:19
assets the country has available
5:21
relative to the external debts it must
5:23
service by the time of the devaluation
5:26
the country is typically very low in
5:27
liquid assets it can use to cover
5:30
external Debt Service
5:32
obligations stage two the private sector
5:35
suffers a debt crisis and the central
5:37
government gets deeper in debt to help
5:39
the private sector typically this occurs
5:42
at the stage of the cycle when the
5:43
government's balance sheet goes from
5:45
being moderately stretched in the years
5:47
ahead of the devaluation to extremely
5:50
stretched when the government is forced
5:51
to step in to address debt problems that
5:54
emerge in the private sector when the
5:56
private sector has financial problems
5:58
the government typic typically plays an
6:00
increased role because it can get money
6:02
and credit much more easily than the
6:04
private sector can during these
6:06
difficult times it is easier for
6:08
governments to borrow because there is
6:10
much more willingness to lend to them
6:12
because everyone knows that their
6:13
central banks can print money and get it
6:16
to governments to repay and because
6:18
governments have the power to tax having
6:20
this greater ability to borrow is
6:22
especially true for those governments
6:24
that have the most established Reserve
6:26
currencies because there is high demand
6:28
to hold that currency to just debt as a
6:31
result when debt conditions deteriorate
6:33
and governments need to save the day
6:35
government debt increases faster than
6:37
private sector debt as shown in the
6:40
charts below it is typical for the
6:42
government debt level to soar while the
6:43
private sector's debt level plunges
6:45
about a year before the crisis and for
6:48
the government debt levels to rise a lot
6:49
relative to private debt levels in 15 of
6:52
the 21 cases where we had data on both
6:55
the government and the private sector
6:57
balance sheet we saw this pattern happen
7:00
when private debt is falling sharply and
7:02
government debt is rising sharply it is
7:04
a short leading indicator of trouble at
7:07
this time government debt problems tend
7:09
to intensify we show a few more measures
7:12
of this below the stock of government
7:14
debt grows in relation to one its
7:16
revenues two the hard assets it has
7:19
available to repay its debts usually in
7:21
the form of reserves and three the
7:24
quantity of money in the economy that is
7:26
available to finance the debt until the
7:28
central bank eventually steps in to
7:30
provide more money and credit to the
7:32
government stage three the central
7:35
government experiences a debt squeeze in
7:37
which the free market demand for its
7:39
debt falls short of the supply of it
7:42
that creates a debt problem if there is
7:44
net selling of the debt that creates a
7:46
much worse problem so net selling of the
7:49
debt is a big red flag the central
7:51
government gets into financial trouble
7:54
when one its finances are squeezed by
7:56
debt and Debt Service expenses that
7:58
limit its ability to spend on what is
8:00
essential and two the holders of the
8:03
debt assets created to finance
8:05
government spending want to sell those
8:07
assets this puts upward pressure on
8:10
interest rates further increasing the
8:12
government's financing costs and
8:14
requiring either painful spending cuts
8:16
or even more borrowing to cover those
8:18
costs more specifically when Debt
8:21
Service becomes a very high percentage
8:22
of income EG 100% it is a red flag
8:26
because it means that it is a squeezing
8:28
out a lot of of spending and or be
8:31
requiring a lot of borrowing and debt
8:33
rollovers that might not happen because
8:35
lender creditors see this situation and
8:37
worry about it leading them to not lend
8:40
or sell their debt assets there Comes A
8:43
Time in the long-term debt cycle when
8:45
The Debt Service becomes so large
8:47
relative to the incomes that it either
8:49
squeezes out other spending because the
8:51
borrowing can't be large enough to allow
8:53
the avoidance of the squeeze or because
8:55
it is so large that it leads to a big
8:57
demand shortage in 25 of the 35 cases we
9:01
studied we saw government Debt Service
9:03
as a percent of government revenues
9:05
accelerate going into the
9:07
crisis given the debts the government
9:09
has built up and the ongoing deficits it
9:12
is running to compensate for a weak
9:14
private sector its debt and Debt Service
9:16
burdens are on a path to continue
9:19
climbing the charts below show the
9:21
average projected path of government
9:23
debt and interest expense at the time of
9:25
devaluation across the historical cases
9:29
at the time of the eventual devaluation
9:31
we can see that the government was
9:32
typically on a path toward indefinitely
9:34
increasing debts and Debt Service absent
9:37
a devaluation of those debts this hasn't
9:40
happened yet in the US but it is moving
9:43
toward happening as far as Europe Japan
9:46
and China go government interest service
9:48
in those places is around half that of
9:50
the us as a percent of GDP Europe and
9:53
China because its government debts are
9:55
lower though the debts of other sectors
9:58
are higher and Japan because its
10:00
interest rates have been much lower for
10:01
a long time but that can change quickly
10:05
especially in Japan where very high
10:06
government debts around 215% of GDP
10:10
could become a problem if refinanced at
10:13
higher rates as we will see later the
10:15
very large government debts Bank of
10:17
Japan Bond purchases and the boj
10:20
artificially holding interest rates at
10:22
extremely low levels led to terrible
10:25
returns for government debt assets
10:27
because of both the low yields on the
10:29
debt debt and the depreciated value of
10:31
the currency faced with a large and
10:33
growing debt burden and financing need a
10:36
classic next step is the pursuit of
10:38
measures to paper over issues and
10:40
creative ways to Source financing
10:42
including accounting tricks use of
10:45
policy and development Banks to create
10:47
off-balance sheet financing frequently
10:50
part of the playbook in Asian crises EG
10:53
Japan and Asian Financial crises use of
10:56
debt guarantees instead of direct
10:58
spending
10:59
Peru 1980s turkey recently the
11:02
government will say that it guarantees
11:04
losses for a certain type of debt which
11:06
encourages borrowing effectively a
11:09
subsidy but it doesn't show up in
11:11
government spending until losses start
11:13
to appear so it can misleadingly seem
11:15
free to the government in 2017 the
11:18
Turkish government rolled out a loan
11:20
guarantee program for businesses in the
11:22
midst of balance of payments pressure
11:25
requiring or heavily incentivizing
11:27
domestic players especially Banks
11:29
pensions and insurers to finance the
11:32
government turkey recently Brazil
11:35
recently sometimes this takes the form
11:37
of extremely beneficial regulatory
11:39
treatment of government debt making a
11:41
risky instrument seem risk-free and
11:44
sometimes manipulation of yield curve
11:46
and financing rates to make it
11:47
attractive US during World War II which
11:51
is effectively backdoor monetary
11:53
financing because it incentivizes Banks
11:55
to lever up at short-term interest rates

to lend to the government

patriotic campaigns to get people to

12:46

12:48
described further below Capital controls
12:51
to keep money from leaving the country
12:53
are common in relatively severe
12:55
situations stage four the selling of the
12:58
government's debt leads to a a free
13:00
market driven tightening of money and
13:02
credit which leads to B A weakening of
13:05
the economy C downward pressure on the
13:08
currency and D declining reserves as the
13:11
Central Bank attempts to defend the
13:12
currency because this tightening is too
13:15
harmful for the economy the Central Bank
13:17
eventually simultaneously eases credit
13:19
and allows a devaluation of the currency
13:22
these events typically accelerate
13:24
investors and Savers flight from the
13:26
country's assets bringing the run on the
13:28
current curcy and the debt to a Breaking
13:30
Point typically the Central Bank
13:33
attempts to defend the currency with
13:34
monetary tightening and Reserve sales
13:37
but is ultimately forced to change
13:38
course due to the painful economic
13:41
effects of tightening and the inadequacy
13:43
of its reserves a relatively large red
13:46
flag for me is when debts rise relative
13:48
to the incomes that are necessary to
13:50
service them to such an extent that
13:52
smart investors recognize losses are
13:54
inevitable I.E because there must be
13:57
either a default or a lot of printing of
13:59
money currency weakness and inflation to
14:02
depreciate the debts in order to avoid a
14:04
default when the lender creditor loses
14:07
faith that they will be adequately paid
14:10
because the debtors won't be able to
14:11
afford to pay debt service or because
14:13
the amount of Debt Service isn't
14:15
sufficient EG won't adequately
14:18
compensate the lender creditor for
14:20
inflation there will be inadequate
14:22
buying relative to the selling of debt
14:24
so the price of debt will have to go
14:26
down so the interest rate will have to
14:28
go up until there is either less
14:30
borrowing or more saving during times of
14:33
risks of war or actual War this is
14:35
worsened because risks of sanctions I.E
14:38
confiscating debt assets excessive
14:41
borrowing debt default and devaluation
14:44
increase Wars or not that is when the
14:46
Doom Loop can kick in I.E when the
14:49
upward pressure on interest rates
14:51
weakens the economy and increases the
14:53
government's future borrowing needs or
14:55
requires big tax increases or spending
14:58
cuts that would be be excessively
14:59
painful at this juncture which then
15:02
creates an even bigger supply demand
15:04
mismatch in the bond market and puts
15:06
even more upward pressure on interest
15:08
rates that is when central banks have to
15:10
come in to save the day by printing
15:12
money and buying the debt and we have
15:14
what we call quantitative easing QE as
15:18
you will see in the charts Below in
15:20
these times there is a simultaneous
15:22
Plunge in foreign inflows to buy local
15:24
bonds government and corporate left
15:26
chart and a spike in real rates as there
15:29
is a classic failed attempt to support
15:31
the currency via Rising interest rates
15:33
and tightening Credit in these periods
15:36
we often see the government shorten the
15:38
maturity of its issuance in order to
15:40
make the bonds more palatable to the
15:42
market when Market participants see that
15:45
these limitations are being reached
15:47
there is selling which worsens the
15:48
supply demand balance when that becomes
15:51
large the central bank is faced with the
15:53
choice of a allowing interest rates to
15:56
rise to a level that will curil
15:58
borrowing and lead to Greater desire to
16:00
lend to the government by redirecting
16:02
money and credit that would have gone to
16:04
other things EG the purchase of other
16:07
Investments or B Printing money and
16:10
buying the debt to make up for the
16:11
demand shortfall history shows and logic
16:14
dictates that it will always choose B
16:17
over a and that the best path is to
16:19
balance a and b when that produces
16:22
enough selling so that inflation Rises
16:24
when the economy is weak the central
16:26
bank is damned if it does print money
16:28
and buy a lot of debt because it
16:30
contributes to terrible currency
16:31
weakness and inflation and it's damned
16:34
if it doesn't because it causes
16:35
extremely tight money extremely high
16:37
interest rates and a very bad economy
16:40
that happens when the debt service
16:42
squeeze becomes intolerable for the
16:44
borrower debtor Andor the lender
16:45
creditor doesn't want to hold the debt
16:48
typically because it is not providing a
16:50
high enough real return the risk of
16:52
default is perceived as high Andor the
16:54
risk of the Central Bank printing a lot
16:56
of money thus devaluing it is high
17:00
when those things happen a doom Loop
17:02
downward spiral in the value of the
17:03
government debt occurs until a new
17:05
equilibrium level is reached when the
17:07
debt is sufficiently destroyed or
17:09
devalued so that the debt burdens are no
17:11
longer
17:12
excessive this hasn't yet happened in
17:14
the US Europe Japan or China below we
17:18
walk through these Dynamics in more
17:20
detail there is a tightening and or
17:22
currency intervention to defend the
17:24
currency but the tightening is abandoned
17:27
because it's too harmful for the economy
17:29
and the currency intervention is
17:30
abandoned because it doesn't work and is
17:32
too costly so the currency e debt
17:36
devalues this situation becomes
17:38
untenable when investors and Savers see
17:40
what's going on and make the logical
17:42
decision to abandon the country's assets
17:44
and currency because there is a high
17:47
risk that in one way or another they
17:48
won't get their buying power back this
17:51
brings the crisis to aead because it
17:53
puts more pressure on the central bank
17:55
to tighten at a time when doing so would
17:57
likely produce unaccept acceptably bad
17:59
economic outcomes a few of the red flags
18:02
of this more advanced stage are interest
18:05
rates rise because there is selling of
18:07
the country's debt assets and because
18:09
the Central Bank typically attempts to
18:11
tighten to defend the currency in the
18:14
face of such depressed conditions such
18:16
an increase in real interest rates is
18:18
unsustainable as it puts too much
18:20
pressure on an economy that is already
18:22
weak and on a government that is facing
18:24
a debt spiral absent lower interest
18:26
rates the tightening worst a weak
18:29
economy which ultimately requires the
18:31
tightening to be abandoned and the
18:33
devaluation to occur while not always
18:36
the case inflation tends to rise and
18:38
become higher than desirable going into
18:40
the crisis constraining the central
18:42
bank's ability to ease without risking
18:45
undesirable High
18:46
inflation due to the weak economy and
18:49
the rising inflation there is
18:51
substantial pressure for the currency to
18:52
fall at this stage there is a big
18:55
Divergence between the floating rate and
18:57
fixed rate cases the policy makers in
19:00
fixed rate cases are fighting against
19:02
currency
19:03
depreciation in fact with high inflation
19:05
the currency is getting more expensive
19:08
right when they need a devaluation in
19:10
the floating rate cases the currency is
19:12
gradually selling off into the economic
19:15
weakness for countries with hard
19:17
currency debts credit spreads rise as
19:19
markets price in a greater likelihood of
19:22
default risky assets price in higher
19:24
risk premiums I.E sell off adding to the
19:28
downward pressure pressure on the
19:29
economy at this stage the Central Bank
19:32
typically sells reserves remember that
19:34
debt works for governments pretty much
19:36
the same way it works for people and
19:38
companies except that governments that
19:40
have the debt denominated in their own
19:42
currency and have the ability to print
19:44
their own currency can print the money
19:46
to pay off their debt also as for people
19:49
and companies governments can build up
19:51
savings to help them prevent financial
19:53
problems when their incomes fall short
19:55
of their expenses for that reason when
19:58
looking at the riskiness of any deta
20:00
including governments one should also
20:02
see what amount of liquid savings they
20:04
have reserves are one of the main forms
20:06
of liquid savings for governments so are
20:09
sovereign wealth funds watching their
20:11
size how fast they are being drawn down
20:14
and how close they are to running out is
20:16
important to identifying the timing of
20:18
debt problems in the process it pays to
20:21
watch for the selling of foreign
20:22
currency and buying of local currency
20:25
which is typically done because this
20:27
reduces the money Supply it is a form of
20:30
tightening as shown in the chart below
20:32
the selling of reserves is typical at
20:34
this stage of the cycle note that in the
20:36
most severe cases reserves are typically
20:39
already low relative to the central
20:40
bank's liabilities EG the stock of money
20:43
that save us hold which gives these
20:45
central banks little Firepower to fight
20:47
the run on the currency when that is the
20:50
case it becomes apparent that their
20:52
currency defense will fail which
20:54
increases the betting against the
20:55
currency and the fleeing of debt
20:57
denominated in it the table below shows
21:00
in more detail past interventions of
21:02
central banks via their reserves across
21:04
all the cases with meaningful
21:06
intervention what you can see is that
21:09
typically before the central bank
21:10
intervenes by selling reserves the
21:13
country has a modest War chest of
21:14
reserves on average around 5% of GDP
21:18
covering 10% of the outstanding money
21:20
supply and government debt outstanding
21:23
to stem Capital flight during the
21:25
intervention phase the Central Bank
21:27
typically spends over half of its
21:29
reserves in total to defend the currency
21:32
reserves in global currency terms have
21:33
fallen by 62% on average typically a lot
21:37
of this selling is concentrated in a
21:39
relatively short period of time for
21:42
example in the worst six-month period of
21:44
intervention reserves decline by 49% in
21:47
the median case typically the currency
21:50
Falls during the currency defense phase
21:52
gold rallies 42% in the median case
21:55
though in some cases the central bank's
21:57
intervention is able to temporarily prop
21:59
up the
22:00
currency then after a roughly 2-year
22:03
defense though it of course varies by
22:05
case the Central Bank gives up at this
22:08
point the reserves back only a small
22:10
amount of the money stock 6% on average
22:13
and a tiny amount of the government debt
22:15
3% on average after the Central Bank
22:18
stops intervening the currency Falls
22:20
further and on average gold has rallied
22:23
another 51% in the median case the
22:26
different cases are shown below at this
22:29
stage it becomes relatively clear that
22:31
the currency is at best highly risky and
22:33
at worst a very bad deal this leads to
22:36
not just investors leaving the debt
22:38
currency but in many cases participants
22:41
in the economy most importantly Banks
22:43
corporations and households making
22:46
prudent drisking moves out of the debt
22:48
and currency here are many of the
22:50
Dynamics we saw in the cases we studied
22:53
which I consider classic signs of being
22:55

23:08
to local currency like they used to
23:11
seeing their revenu swing in local
23:12
currency terms even as dollar prices
23:15
stay more stable they begin to think of
23:17
their local currency as the currency to
23:19
hedge even though in traditional
23:21
investing they should hedge the foreign
23:23
currencies domestic corporations decide
23:26
to increase their amount of hedging of
23:28
the local currency especially those with
23:30
hard currency debts hedging involves a
23:33
forward contract to sell the local
23:35
currency and buy foreign currency which
23:37
lowers the forward exchange rate and
23:39
drags down the spot exchange rate
23:41
similarly foreign corporations with
23:43
domestic subsidiaries ensure cash is
23:45
promptly swept out of the country
23:48

start accumulating all new reserves in a

25:49
can't sell their assets too little
