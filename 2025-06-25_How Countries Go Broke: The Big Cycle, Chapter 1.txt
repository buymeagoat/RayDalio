chapter one part one overview of the big debt cycle chapter one The Big debt
0:30
cycle in a tiny nutshell my goal for this chapter is to convey in seven pages a very brief but
0:36
complete description of the mechanics of a typical big debt cycle how the Machine
0:41
Works Credit is the primary vehicle for funding spending and it can easily be
0:46
created because one person's spending is another's earnings when there is a lot of credit creation people spend and earn
0:53
more most asset prices go up and most everyone loves it paying back debt is
0:59
much less enjoy able as a result Central governments and central banks have a bias toward creating a lot of credit
1:06
credit also creates debt that has to be paid back which has the opposite effect
1:11
I.E when debts have to be paid back it creates less spending lower incomes and lower asset prices which people don't
1:18
like in other words when someone a borrower deor borrows money called principle at a cost an interest rate the
1:26
borrower deor can spend more money than they have in earnings and savings over the near term but over the long term
1:33
this requires them to pay back the principal plus interest and when they have to pay it back it requires them to
1:39
spend less money than they have this Dynamic is why the credit spending Juck debt paying back Dynamic is inherently
1:47
cyclical the short-term debt cycle everyone who has been around long enough to be affected by it several times
1:54
should be well acquainted with the short-term debt cycle it starts with money and credit being provided readily
2:00
when economic activity and inflation are lower than desired and when interest rates are low relative to inflation
2:07
rates and low in relation to the rates of return on other Investments those
2:12
conditions encourage borrowing to spend and invest which causes asset prices economic activity and inflation to pick
2:19
up until they are higher than desired at which time money and credit are restrained and interest rates become
2:26
relatively high in relation to inflation rates and rates return on other Investments this leads to less borrowing
2:33
to spend and invest which leads to lower asset prices a slowing of economic activity and lower inflation which leads
2:41
interest rates to come down money and credit to become easier and the cycle to Begin Again these Cycles have typically
2:48
lasted about 6 years give or take 3 years short-term debt Cycles add up to
2:54
Big long-term debt Cycles what isn't paid enough attention is the way in which these short-term debt Cycles add
3:01
up to Big long-term debt Cycles because credit is a stimulant that creates a high people want more of it so there is
3:08
a bias toward creating it this leads debt to rise over time which typically
3:13
leads to most of the short-term cyclical highs and lows in debt to be higher than the ones before these add up to create
3:20
the long-term debt cycle which ends when it becomes unsustainable the capacity to take on
3:26
more debt is different early in the big debt cycle when debt burdens are lower and there is more potential for credit
3:32
chart debt to be able to fund highly profitable Endeavors than it is later in the cycle when debt burdens are higher
3:39
and lenders have fewer productive options in that early part it is easy to borrow even to borrow a lot and pay it
3:47
back these early short-term Cycles are primarily driven by the previously described availability and economics of
3:54
borrowing and spending and also a lingering cautiousness brought about by memories of the pain of the most recent
4:00
time when money was tight early in the big debt cycle when
4:05
debts and total debt service are relatively low in relation to incomes and other assets increases and decreases
4:11
in credit spending debt and Debt Service are primarily determined by the previously described incentives with
4:18
less risk but late in the big debt cycle when debts and debt service costs get
4:23
high relative to income and the value of other assets that can be used to meet one's Debt Service obligations
4:30
the risks of default are higher also late in the big debt cycle when there are a lot of debt assets and liabilities
4:37
relative to income The Balancing Act of trying to keep interest rates high enough to satisfy lender creditors
4:43
without having them too high for borrower debts becomes more challenging that's because one person's debts are
4:50
another's assets and both must be satisfied so while short-term debt Cycles end because of the previously
4:56
described economic considerations long-term debt Cycles end because the debt burdens are too great to be
5:03
sustained said differently because it is more enjoyable to borrow and spend if one isn't careful debt and Debt Service
5:10
can grow like a cancer eating up one's buying power and squeezing out other consumption this is what makes the
5:17
long-term big debt cycle throughout the Millennia and across countries what has driven the big debt cycle and has
5:24
created the big market and economic problems that go along with it is the creation of unsustainably large amounts
5:30
of debt assets and debt liabilities relative to the amounts of money Goods services and investment Assets in
5:37
existence said more simply a debt is a promise to deliver money a debt crisis
5:43
occurs when there have been more promises made than there is money to deliver on them when that happens the
5:49
central bank is forced to choose between a printing a lot of money and devaluing it or B not printing a lot of money and
5:57
having a big debt default crisis in the end they always print and devalue either
6:03
way VIA default or devaluation the creation of too much debt eventually causes debt assets EG bonds to be worth
6:11
less while there are variations in how each of these cases plays out the most important factor is whether the debt is
6:17
denominated in a currency that the central bank can print but no matter the variation we almost always see that it
6:24
becomes relatively undesirable to hold the debt assets I.E bonds relative to
6:29
holding the productive capacity of the economy I.E equities Andor owning other
6:35
more stable forms of money eg gold to me it is interesting and inappropriate that
6:41
when credit rating agencies rate the credit of a central government they don't rate the riskiness of its debt
6:46
losing value they only rate the risk of default on the debt which gives the misimpression that all higher rated debt
6:53
is a safe storeold of value said differently because central banks can bail out central government
7:00
the riskiness of central government's debts are hidden creditors would be better served if the rating agencies
7:05
rated the riskiness of the debt losing value through both default and devaluation after all these bonds are
7:12
supposed to be stor holds of wealth and should be rated as such as you will see in this study that is how I look at
7:18
bonds for countries with debts denominated in their own currencies I.E in a currency they can print I rate
7:25
Central government's debts separately from their central banks to show how risky they are and I rate the risks of
7:31
central bank's debts by considering the risk of the devaluation of money to be as if not more probable than a default
7:39
on government debt default or devaluation I don't care what I care
7:44
about is losing my storeold of wealth which inevitably will happen one way or another following the debt Cycle's
7:51
progression the main difference between a short-term debt cycle and a long-term big debt cycle has to do with the
7:57
central bank's ability to turn the around for the short-term debt cycle its contraction phase can be reversed with a
8:04
heavy dose of money and credit that brings the economy up from a depressed disinflationary state because the
8:10
economy has the capacity to produce another phase of non-inflationary growth but the long-term debt Cycles
8:16
contraction phase cannot be reversed by producing more money and credit because existing levels of debt growth and debt
8:23
assets are unsustainable and holders of debt assets want to get out of them because they believe that one way or
8:29
another they will be poor stor holds of wealth think of the big debt Cycles progression like the progression of a
8:35
disease or a life cycle through stages that exhibit different symptoms by identifying these symptoms one can
8:42
identify approximately where the cycle is in its progression with some expectations of how it is likely to
8:49
progress from there described most simply the big debt cycle moves from
8:54
sound hard money and credit to increasingly loose money and credit to a debt bust that leads to to a return to
9:00
sound hard money and credit brought about by necessity more specifically at
9:05
first there is heathy borrowing by the private sector that can be paid back then the private sector over borrows has
9:12
losses and has problems paying it back then the government sector tries to help
9:17
over borrows has losses and has problems paying it back then the Central Bank
9:22
tries to help by printing money and buying the government debt and has problems paying it back which leads it
9:28
to monit I a lot more debt if it can I.E if the debt is denominated in the currency that it can print though not
9:36
all cases progress in exactly the same way most cases progress through the following five stages one the sound
9:44
money stage when net debt levels are low money is sound the country is
9:49
competitive and debt growth fuels productivity growth which creates incomes that are more than enough to pay
9:55
back the debts this leads to increases in financial wealth and confidence
10:00
credit is the promise to deliver money unlike credit which requires a payment of money at a later date money settles
10:07
transactions I.E if money is given the transaction is complete whereas if credit is given money is owed it's easy
10:15
to create credit anyone can create credit but not anyone can create money for example I can create credit by
10:22
accepting your promise to pay me money even if you don't have the money as a result credit easily grows so there is
10:28
much more credit than there is money the most effective money is both a medium of exchange and a stor hold of wealth that
10:35
is widely accepted around the world at the early stage of the big debt cycle money is hard which means that it is a
10:42
medium of exchange that is also a storeold of wealth that can't easily be increased in Supply such as gold
10:49
sterling silver and Bitcoin cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is now emerging as an accepted hard currency
10:56
because it is a currency that is widely accepted around the world and is limited in Supply the biggest most common risk
11:03
to money becoming an ineffective storeold of wealth is the risk that a lot of it will be created imagine having
11:09
the ability to create money who wouldn't be tempted to do a lot of that those who can always are that creates the big debt
11:17
cycle in the early part of the big debt cycle a money is typically hard EG gold
11:24
and the paper money that circulates like money is convertible into the hard money at a fixed price and B there isn't a lot
11:31
of paper money and debt which is the promise to pay money outstanding the big
11:36
debt cycle consists of the building up of a paper money and debt assets or liabilities relative to B hard money and
11:44
real assets EG goods and services and relative to the income that is required
11:49
to service the debt basically the big debt cycle works like a Ponzi scheme or
11:55
musical chairs with investors holding an increasing amount of debt assets in the belief that they can convert them into
12:01
money that will have buying power to get real things yet as the amount of the debt assets that are held up by that
12:07
Faith increases relative to the real things that conversion becomes more obviously impossible until that is
12:14
realized and the process of selling the debt to get the hard money and real assets
12:19
begins at the early stage of the debt cycle private and government debt and Debt Service ratios are one low relative
12:27
to incomes Andor two low relative to liquid assets for example government
12:33
debt and Debt Service are low relative to government tax revenue and or low relative to government liquid assets EG
12:40
reserves and other savings such as Sovereign wealth assets that can easily be converted into money for example when
12:47
the big debt cycle that we are in began in 1944 the ratios of a US Government
12:52
debt and B US money supply divided by the amount of gold the US government had
12:58
were equal to a 7x and B 1.3x respectively whereas now these ratios
13:04
are A 37x and B 6X respectively during this early stage in the cycle debt
13:11
levels debt growth economic growth and inflation are neither too hot nor too cold and finances are both sound at this
13:20
stage in the cycle risky assets are relatively inexpensive relative to Safe
13:25
assets that is because the memories of the prior period in which there was great Damage Done affects psychology and
13:32
pricing for example in the late 1940s and early 1950s stock earnings yields
13:38
were roughly 4X that of bond yields during this stage there is a healthy economy and good investment returns that
13:45
lead to the next stage two the debt bubble stage when debt and investment
13:51
growth are greater than can be service from the incomes being produced in this stage money is readily available and
13:57
cheap there is a debt financed economic expansion and an economic boom demands
14:03
for and prices of goods services and investment assets are driven up by a lot of debt financed buying sentiment is
14:10
very bullish and by most conventional measures the market is overpriced in
14:16
this stage there are typically amazing new inventions that are truly transformative that investors invest in
14:22
without an ability or care to assess whether the present value of their future cash flows will be greater or
14:28
less than their costs this Dynamic eventually produces a bubble that is reflected in the rates of debt and Debt
14:35
Service growth to finance speculation being greater than the income growth rates that are needed to service the
14:41
debts in this stage markets and economies seem great most everyone believes that they will get better they
14:48
are financed by a lot of borrowing and wealth is created out of nothing by wealth being created out of nothing I
14:55
mean that there is greater imagined wealth rather than actual existing wealth wealth for example bubble periods
15:01
are identifiable by extensive periods EG 3 years of debt growth that is
15:06
significantly faster than income growth High asset prices relative to traditional measures of the present
15:12
values of likely future cash flows and many other factors that I measure in my bubble indicator you can find the
15:20
indicator here a contemporary example is the Unicorn that is valued at over 1
15:25
billion that has made the owner a billionaire on paper but has only raised $50 million in capital because
15:31
speculative Venture capitalists put in the money to get option-like chips in case it does well bubbles can go on a
15:38
while before the top is made however they inevitably lead to the next stage three the top stage when the
15:46
bubble pops and there is a credit debt Market CH economic contraction the
15:52
popping of the bubble occurs due to a combination of a tightening of money and the prior rate of debt growth being
15:57
unsustainable it is just that simple when the bubble is popped a self-reinforcing contraction begins so
16:04
the debt problems spread very quickly like an aggressive cancer so it is very important for policy makers to deal with
16:10
it quickly either to reverse it or to guide the deleveraging to its conclusion
16:16
in most cases the debt contraction can be temporarily reversed by giving the system a heavy dose of what caused the
16:22
debt problem I.E by creating more credit and debt that continues until it can't
16:28
continue anymore at which time a big deleveraging occurs four the
16:33
deleveraging stage when there is a painful bringing down of debt and Debt Service levels to be in line with income
16:39
levels so that the debt levels are sustainable at the beginning of this stage in the big debt cycle the first
16:46
cracks typically spread from the private sector to the central government and then to the central bank net selling of
16:52
debt assets especially net selling of government debt assets is a big red flag
16:58
when that happens s conditions will deteriorate quickly unless managed very well and very quickly by Central
17:04
governments and central banks that selling takes the form of runs on banks
17:09
by runs on banks I mean the turning in of debt assets to get real money which lenders like Banks don't have enough of
17:16
when debt problems become apparent the holders of the debt assets sell their debt assets which drives interest rates
17:22
on the debt up this makes the debt more difficult to service hence more risky which drives interest rates higher the
17:30
selling of the government's debt leads to a a free market driven tightening of money and credit which leads to B A
17:37
weakening of the economy C downward pressure on the currency and D declining
17:42
reserves as the Central Bank attempts to defend the currency classically these runs accelerate and feed on themselves
17:49
as holders of debt assets see that one way or another through default or through the devaluation of their money
17:56
they will lose the buying power that they had believed was stor stored in these debt assets causing great shifts
18:01
in Market values and wealth until debts are defaulted on restructured and or
18:07
monetized because this tightening proves too harmful for the economy the Central Bank eventually simultaneously eases
18:14
credit and allows a devaluation of the currency the devaluation of money can
18:19
itself be the reason to sell the debt asset because it becomes a poor storeold of wealth so whether there is a
18:25
tightening of money that leads to debt defaults and a bad eon eony or an easing of money that produces a devaluation of
18:32
money and debt assets it is not good for the debt asset this Dynamic creates what
18:37
is called a death spiral because it is a self-reinforcing debt contraction dynamic in which the rising interest
18:44
rates cause problems that creditors see leading them to sell the debt assets which leads to even higher interest
18:50
rates or the need to print more money which devalues the money and leads to even more selling of the debt assets and
18:57
the currency and so on until the spiral runs its course when this happens to
19:02
government debt the realization that too much debt is the problem naturally leads
19:07
to the inclination to cut spending and borrowing however because one person's spending is another's income cutting
19:14
spending at such times typically only contributes to increases in debt to income ratios that is typically when
19:21
policies are shifted to a mix of debt restructurings and debt monetizations with the mix chosen primarily dependent
19:28
on how much much of the debt is denominated in the country's currency this defaulting on restructuring of and
19:34
or monetizing debt reduces the debt burdens relative to incomes until a new equilibrium is reached the movement to a
19:42
stable equilibrium typically takes place via a few painful adjustment spasms because borderline Financial soundness
19:49
is achieved before secure Financial soundness classically the deleveraging process progresses as follows early in
19:57
this recession depression phase central banks bring interest rates down and make credit more available however when a
20:04
debts are large and a debt contraction is underway B interest rates can't be lowered anymore I.E when they fall
20:11
around 0% C there is not enough demand for government debt and D the monetary
20:17
easing is not enough to offset the self-reinforcing depression pressures the central bank is forced to switch to
20:24
new tools to stimulate the economy classically to stimulate the economy the Central Bank must lower interest rates
20:31
to below nominal economic growth rates inflation rates and bond rates but that is difficult to do when they approach 0%
20:38
at the same time the central government is typically getting itself into a lot more debt because tax revenues are down
20:45
and spending is up to support the private sector yet there is not enough private sector demand to buy that debt
20:51
the central government experiences a debt squeeze in which the free market demand for its debt falls short of the
20:57
supply of it if there is net selling of the debt that creates a much worse problem often in
21:04
this deleveraging stage of the cycle there is a pushing on a string a phrase coined by policy makers in the 1930s it
21:11
occurs late in the long-term debt cycle when Central Bankers struggle to convert their stimulative policies into
21:18
increased spending because Savers investors and businesses fear borrowing and spending and or there is deflation
21:25
so the risk-free interest that they are getting is relative attractive to them at such times it is difficult to get
21:32
people to stop saving in cash even when interest rates go to 0% or even below
21:37
0% this phase is characterized by the economy entering a deflationary weak or
21:43
negative growth period as people and investors hoard lowrisk typically government guaranteed cash at this stage
21:50
central banks must choose between keeping money hard which will lead debtors to default on their debts which
21:56
will lead to deflationary depressions or making money soft by printing a lot of it which will devalue both it and the
22:03
debt because paying off debt with hard money causes such severe market and economic downturns when faced with this
22:10
Choice central banks always eventually choose to print and devalue money of course each country's Central Bank can
22:17
only print that country's money which brings me to my next big point at this stage if it has the ability to print
22:23
money the Central Bank creates a substantial amount of money in credit and throws it aggressively at the
22:29
markets it typically buys government debt and private sector debt of systemically important entities that are
22:36
at risk of defaulting in order to make up for the private sector's inadequate demand for debt and to keep interest
22:42
rates artificially low and it sometimes buys equities and creates incentives for
22:47
people to buy Goods services and financial assets at this stage it is
22:52
also typically desirable to devalue the currency because that is stimulative to the economy and raises inflation rates
22:59
thus negating the deflationary pressures if the currency is linked to gold silver
23:04
or something else that link is typically broken and there is a move to a Fiat monetary system if the currency isn't
23:11
linked I.E if the currency is already a fiat currency devaluing it relative to
23:17
other stor holds of wealth and other currencies is helpful in some cases the central banks moves can drive nominal
23:24
interest rates higher either because the Central Bank tightens monetary policy to fight inflation or because it doesn't
23:31
tighten money to fight inflation and holders of the debt don't want to buy the newly issued government debt and or
23:37
they want to sell it because it doesn't provide an adequate return it is important to watch real and nominal
23:43
interest rates and the supply and demand for debt to understand what is happening at such times extraordinary policies to
23:50
get money like imposing extraordinary taxes and capital controls become common
23:55
this deleveraging stage is typically a painful time when debt burdens are reduced by defaults restructurings and
24:02
or devaluations this is when an aggressive mix of debt restructurings and debt
24:07
monetizations inevitably takes place to reduce the debt and Debt Service burdens relative to incomes in a typical
24:14
deleveraging the debt to income ratio has the be lowered by roughly 50% give
24:19
or take about 20% it can be done well or poorly when it is done well which I call
24:26
a beautiful deleveraging central government governments and central banks simultaneously do both debt
24:31
restructurings and monetary stimulations in a balanced way the restructurings reduce debt burdens and are deflationary
24:38
while the monetary stimulations also reduce debt burdens by providing money and credit to make it easier to buy debt
24:46
but are inflationary and stimulative to the economy so if they get the balance right positive growth occurs with
24:52
falling debt burdens and acceptable inflation whether done well or poorly this is the stage of the big debt cycle
24:59
that reduces a lot of the debt burden and establishes the bottom that can be built on to begin the next big debt
25:06
cycle five the big debt crisis recedes when a new equilibrium is reached and a
25:12
new cycle begins in order to have a viable money credit debt system it is
25:17
imperative that a money debt is sound enough to be a viable stor hold of wealth B debt and Debt Service burdens
25:25
are in line with the incomes to service them so that debt growth is sustainable C creditors and debtors both believe
25:32
that those things will exist and D the availability of money and credit and real interest rates begin to fall in
25:39
line with that which is needed by both lender creditors and borrower debtors this late phase of the big cycle is when
25:46
there is a movement to those things happening it requires both psychological and fundamental adjustments after a big
25:53
deleveraging it is typically difficult to convince lender creditors to lend because the Deval valuations to
25:59
restructurings they experienced in the deleveraging make them risk averse so it is imperative that the central
26:05
government and the Central Bank take credibility restoring actions these generally involve bringing their
26:11
finances in order by a the central government earning more money than it spends and or B the Central Bank making
26:19
money hard again by offering High real yields raising reserves and or linking
26:24
the currency to something hard like gold or a strong currency typically in this
26:29
stage interest rates need to be relatively high in relation to inflation rates and more than high enough to
26:35
compensate for currency weakness so it pays to be a lender and is costly to be a borrower this stage of the cycle can
26:42
be very attractive for lender creditors the stage that the big debt cycle is in
26:47
is also reflected in the types of monetary policies being used as the big debt cycle progresses central banks have
26:54
to change how they run monetary policy in order to keep the credit debt economic expansion going so by observing
27:01
what type of monetary policy they are using one can surmise about what stage the big debt cycle is in the phases in
27:08
monetary policy and the conditions that lead to them are as follows phase one a linked I.E hard
27:15
monetary system mp1 this is the type of monetary policy that existed from 1944
27:22
until 1971 this type of monetary policy ends when the debt bubble bursts and there is
27:28
the previously described run on the bank Dynamic which is a run from credit assets to the hard money and the limited
27:35
amount of hard money causes massive defaults this creates a compelling desire to print money rather than leave
27:41
the supply of it limited by the supply of the gold or hard money that exists to be exchanged at the promised price phase
27:49
two a Fiat money interest rate driven monetary policy mp2 during this phase interest rates
27:57
Bank Reserves and cash Capital requirements are also controllers of the amounts of credit debt growth this Fiat
28:03
monetary policy phase both allows more flexibility and provides less assurance that money printing won't be so large
28:10
that it will devalue money and debt assets the US was in this phase from 1971 until 2008 it ends when interest
28:18
rate changes no longer work EG interest rates hit 0% and there is a need to ease
28:24
monetary policy Andor the private market demand for the debt debt being created falls short of the supply being sold so
28:32
that if the central bank did not print the money and buy the debt money and credit would be tighter and interest
28:38
rates would be higher than desired phase three a Fiat monetary system with debt monetization
28:45
MP3 this type of monetary policy is implemented by the Central Bank using its ability to create money and credit
28:52
to buy investment assets it is the go-to alternative when interest rates can no
28:57
longer will be lowered and when private market demand for debt assets mostly bonds and mortgages though it can also
29:04
include other Financial assets like equities is not large enough to buy the supply at an acceptable interest rate it
29:11
is good for financial asset prices so it tends to benefit disproportionately those who have Financial assets it won't
29:19
effectively deliver money into the hands of those who are financially most stressed and it won't be very targeted
29:25
the US was in this phase from 2008 until 2020 phase four a Fiat money system with
29:33
coordinated big fiscal deficit and big debt monetization policy MP4 this type of monetary policy is used
29:40
when in order to make the system work well central government fiscal policy and Central Bank monetary policy have to
29:47
be coordinated in order to get money and credit into the hands of people and entities that need it most while
29:54
creating money and credit typically temporarily alleviates the debt problem it does not rectify the problem phase
30:01
five a big deleveraging MP5 this is when there must be a big reduction in debt
30:06
and Debt Service payments through a debt restructuring Andor a debt monetization when managed in the best possible way
30:13
what I call a beautiful deleveraging the deflationary ways of reducing debt burdens EG through debt restructurings
30:21
are balanced with the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens EG by monetizing them so that the deleveraging
30:28
occurs without having unacceptable amounts of either deflation or inflation
30:33
the big debt cycle sequence to keep in mind is first the private sector over borrows has losses and has problems
30:40
paying it back I.E as a debt crisis then to help the government over borrows has
30:46
losses and has problems paying it back then to help out the Central Bank buys
30:51
the government debt and takes losses to fund those purchases and to fund other debtors in trouble because it is the
30:58
lender of Last Resort the Central Bank prints a lot of money and buys a lot of debt then at its worst the Central Bank
31:06
loses a lot of money on the debt it bought while it is said that modern Central Bank prints money to buy the
31:12
debt the central bank doesn't literally print money instead it borrows money reserves from commercial banks that it
31:19
pays a very short-term interest rate on at its most extreme the central bank can
31:24
lose money because the interest earnings it gets on the debt it B bought are less than the interest that it has to pay out
31:30
on the money it borrowed so when these amounts become large it can find itself in a self- reinforcing spiral of having
31:37
to buy debt which leads it to have losses and negative cash flows which leads it to need to print more money to
31:43
service its debt and to need to buy more debt which ends up having more losses which requires it to do more of the same
31:50
this is the death spal I mentioned earlier when done in large amounts the printing devalues the money and creates
31:57
inflationary recessions or depressions if interest rates rise the Central Bank
32:03
loses money on its Bond Holdings because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the
32:09
interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought this is notable but not a big red flag until the central bank
32:16
has a very large negative net worth and is forced to print more money to cover the negative cash flow that it
32:22
experiences due to less money coming in on its assets than has to go out to service its liabilities
32:28
that is what I mean when I say the Central Bank goes broke while the central bank doesn't default on its
32:33
debts it can't make its debt service payments without printing money eventually the debt restructurings and
32:39
debt monetizations reduce the size of the debts relative to incomes and the debt cycle runs its course phase six the
32:47
return to hard money MP6 in this phase the central government takes actions to restore the soundness
32:54
of its money and credit Char debt this type of of monetary policy occurs after the debt has been written down through
33:01
debt defaults restructurings and debt monetizations so the debt levels relative to the incomes and amounts of
33:08
money that are available to service the debts can be brought back into alignment as previously described it comes after
33:15
those who held the debt assets were burned by the defaults Andor inflationary periods so confidence in
33:21
holding debt assets has to be rebuilt at this stage countries typically go back
33:26
to mp1 I.E a hard asset backing monetary policy or mp2 an interest rate money
33:33
supply targeted monetary policy that is beneficial to lender creditors via High real interest rates for great countries
33:40
with great Empires the end of the big debt cycle has meant the end of their prominence a few concluding
33:47
observations it pays to build up Savings in the good times so there are savings to draw on in the bad times there are
33:54
costs to having too much savings as well as too little savings and no one gets the balance exactly right big debt
34:02
crises are inevitable throughout history only a very few well-disciplined countries have
34:07
avoided them that is because lending Is Never Done perfectly relative to the incomes that are needed to service it
34:14
and it is often done badly because people always want more credit and that turns into debt debt levels get beyond
34:21
that which is sustainable which leads to the need to bring the debt burdens down which typically leads to a mixture of
34:27
debt defaults restructurings and the creating of money and credit leading a
34:32
debt crisis to occur and people's psychology reinforces the cycle the bubble period makes people more
34:39
optimistic causing them to borrow more and the bust causes people to be more pessimistic causing them to cut spending
34:46
even though this progression has happened many times in history most policy makers and investors think their
34:52
current circumstances and monetary system won't change the change is Unthinkable and then it happens suddenly
34:59
the best way to anticipate a debt crisis happening is not by focusing on a single influence or number like debt as a
35:05
percent of GDP It Is by understanding and focusing on a number of interrelated
35:11
dynamics that we will get into especially in the next two chapters if debts are denominated in a country's own
35:18
currency its Central Bank can and will print the money to alleviate the debt
35:23
crisis this allows them to manage it better than if they couldn't print the money but of course it also reduces the
35:29
value of the money if the debt is not denominated in currencies that their central banks can print then they will
35:35
have debt defaults and deflationary depressions measured in the currency that they owe and can't print all debt
35:42
crises even big ones can be managed well by Economic Policy makers restructuring
35:47
and monetizing them so that the deflationary ways of reducing the debt burdens I.E writing off and
35:53
restructuring debt and the inflationary ways of reducing debt burd s creating
35:58
money and credit and giving it to the debtors to make it easier for them to service their debts balance each other
36:06
the key is to spread the paying back over time for example if the debt to income ratio needs to Fall by about 50%
36:12
to make it sustainable a debt restructuring that spreads it out to be at a rate of 3% or 4% per year would be
36:20
much less traumatic than one that is about 50% in one year debt crises
36:25
provide great risks and opportunities that have been shown to both destroy Empires and provide great investment
36:31
opportunities for investors if they understand how they work and have good principles for navigating them well if
36:37
you try to focus on debt Cycles precisely or Focus your attention on the short term you won't see them it's like
36:44
comparing two snowflakes and missing that they are pretty much the same because they're not exactly the same
36:50
that's it in a nutshell in the rest of this study I will get into the mechanics in Greater depth show the actual
36:55
archetypical sequences that have played out over 35 cases look at how the big
37:01
debt cycle and big cycle that includes the other big cycles for instance cycles
37:06
of internal and external order that started in 1944 and that we are currently in the late stages of have
37:13
transpired relative to this template and briefly look at the Chinese and Japanese big cycles and a number of other cases
37:20
the Japanese case is interesting because Japan is further along in its big debt cycle notably its large debt Deb and
37:27
debt monetizations have led to the depreciation of its currency and debt which led holders of its bonds to have
37:34
losses of 45% relative to holding US dollar debt since 2013 and losses of 60% relative to
37:42
holding gold since 2013 in the final chapters I will share how I am processing the us today
37:49
relative to this template how the us could reduce the risk of an acute debt crisis and how I read the five big
37:55
forces today the views expressed in this article are that of the author Ray
