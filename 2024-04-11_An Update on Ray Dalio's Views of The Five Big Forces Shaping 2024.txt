I'm Jim hasell editor of the Bridgewater daily observations earlier this year we published a daily observations by
0:06
Bridgewater founder and CIO Mentor Ray Delio where he described his five big forces framework and how these forces
0:12
will shape 2024 and the years to come and we'll link to that here considering
0:19
all that's happened in just the last 3 months in markets economies and certainly on the geopolitical front I
0:25
thought it' be interesting to sit down with Ray to get his latest thinking on these Dynamics we did that last week and today we're
0:32
sharing an edited version of that conversation Ray hits each of the five
0:37
big forces and elaborates on where we stand with each and he also discusses how these forces connect with each other
0:43
so in today's podcast you'll hear Ray discuss the debt money and economic Force including Ray's thoughts on the
0:50
potential for fed easing when inflation remains above Target as well as portfolio considerations in today's
0:56
environment he also discusses the internal order Force that's the second force with an emphasis on the 2024 US
1:03
presidential election he hits on the external World Order Force including Rising geopolitical conflicts and rais
1:10
re on what's happening in China he talks about the force of nature notably
1:15
climate change and its Economic Consequences and lastly he talks about the force of human inventiveness
1:21
including the potential for AI to bring radical change in the coming years we
1:26
start off with a question from me Ray on his five big forces overall Ray it is good to see you I
Chapter 1: Five Big Forces Overview
1:33
believe you're in Connecticut is that correct y it's good to know that you're back on us soil because you've been all
1:39
over the world and there's a lot going on in the world right now I think everyone knows we're two years into a
1:44
global tightening cycle with markets pricing in fed easing right around the corner even though inflation's still
1:51
running uh above Target we've got geopolitical Strife seemingly getting
1:56
worse not better as as we see conflicts between Russia and Ukraine continuing
2:01
between Israel and Gaza there's a simmering conflict on the North uh of Israel and Lebanon that could even be
2:08
more explosive we have of course the China and Taiwan situation stocks gold
2:13
Bitcoin are all making new highs we have a consequential US presidential election
2:19
approaching at a time of as you've noted many times ever increasing polarization
2:25
we have radical new technology in the form of AI um which has huge implic ations for productivity and the
2:32
profitability of a subset of companies and and of course we're in the midst of a of a climate crisis I thought it'd be
2:38
a perfect time to once again sit down with you get your thoughts on how you're seeing these kinds of big Dynamics in
2:44
the world and from today's conversation I thought we'd do that by first asking you to briefly describe your five big
2:51
forces which can explain a lot of what we're seeing and then we can delve a little bit deeper into each of them and
2:57
look at how they're playing out across country so welcome and let's get right into it with uh your overview of of these five big
3:04
forces yeah so you know because I learned in my lifetime that many of the
3:10
things that surprised me surprised me because they never happened in my lifetime before I learned that I needed
3:17
to study history and I saw that many of them repeated through history and
3:22
sometimes we lose the big picture because we're squinting at the details and I went back over history over the
3:30
last 500 years really to First deal with uh the first three big forces that
3:36
hadn't happened in my lifetime and then I saw the other two the first is the amounts of debt
3:43
creation and then monetization of the debts when the um um there isn't enough
3:49
money in terms of the supply and demand for credit and its impact on the economy
3:56
and the value of the dollar so I wanted to study the rise and declines of reserved currencies over that 500 years
4:04
uh the second is the degree of conflict internal conflict of
4:11
populism on the left and the right creating irreconcilable differences that
4:18
um are uh threatening the Democracy threatening the system in many ways the
4:24
amount of the wealth gaps and uh values gaps that are behind that and the amount
4:31
of uh political polarity not uh go voting across parting lines and the like
4:38
the greatest since 1900 and the third of course is the
4:43
great power conflict Global geopolitical great conflict between rival power
4:50
particularly China vying for power you know last time that happened the last
4:55
time all of these happened was the 1930 to 45 Peri and then I learned by studying the last
5:04
500 years and uh and before that um acts of nature uh droughts floods and
5:11
pandemics had an even bigger impact than all of those other things that I've mentioned um uh they killed more people
5:20
and they toppled more orders more demestic orders more International orders than uh the first three so uh
5:28
climate is a big deal and it's certainly a big deal now and then uh number five
5:35
throughout history um the inventions of new technologies man's learning and
5:41
inventing of new technologies um and uh not only their economic implications but their war and
5:49
Military implications but um the repeated time through history of
5:55
discovering weapons secretly finding the weapons that you show the other side and
6:01
the other side submits because they can't beat the weapon that Dynamic has
6:06
Al also been in history and these cannot be looked at as individual things
6:12
because they're interdependent for example the United States being overextended and you know we're in 80
6:20
countries and then uh fighting two Wars you could have a third war on another front has economic implications or
6:27
climate has economic implications and to see them transpire in cycles for logical
6:33
reasons that the Cycles exist were discoveries and my framework so those
6:38
are the things I think almost anything that you mentioned and anything that's
6:44
important falls under one of those five categories and they certainly relate to each other yeah and on that front you
Chapter 2: The Debt/Money/Economic Force
6:52
know you wrote at the beginning of the year we asked you to write your thoughts about 2024 and and if you hit on the
6:59
first big one that's sort of the debt money markets economy Force you you
7:04
noted then that in a in a wire which we'll link to here that that force was
7:12
moderately low when looked at in isolation due to the current market pricing being roughly in line with
7:17
fundamentals and a lack of sort of big problems associated with that force on the horizon that couldn't be
7:23
well-managed but you also said that the risk Rises significantly when you
7:28
considering conjunction with the internal order force and you cited the 2024 elections and the external order
7:35
force and so I'm wondering if you could update us now as you look at this debt
7:40
money economy Force um how you assess it right now in connection to those other
7:46
two threats you were talking about well there's certainly not going to be enough money you know you can get the money
7:53
from two places you can tax it or you can uh print it so if we look at at the
8:00
the situation of the of the central government um and you do the projections
8:08
um you can see how the combination of the higher debt service payments um
8:14
together with um the needs for greater defense spending um greater climate
8:21
spending a and then you take the entitlements and other things you're
8:26
seeing a Debt Service crowding out of consumption happening in the budget
8:33
deficits and then you're also seeing Supply demand issues of selling those
8:38
bonds to the rest of the world because um no longer are they as attractive and
8:45
as a percentage of their port for of foreigners portfolios they're an issue so we certainly have something that you
8:53
cannot extrapolate into many years before we
8:59
have that particular problem I think let's talk about the bond market for a moment and easing that's built into it
9:06
um so I think that there's a mistaken popular view that there should be an
9:13
easing so if you look at the or magnitude of easing that is um the largest since I think it's like 1981 or
9:22
two there's a lot of uh discounting I mean I think it's U nearly 200 basis
9:27
points in the next two uh two years kind of discounting now let's step back and say uh what should the rate structure be
9:36
now I think if you uh just uh look at what the equilibrium levels are which I
9:43
mean uh appropriate that there is um a real interest rate that's high enough
9:50
for the Creditor without being too high for the debtor which by the way becomes a difficult Balancing Act the more debt
9:57
you create and and you look let's the inflation rate um you can pick the
10:03
number of what people think the inflation rate is a lot of that those numbers would be in the vicinity of uh
10:10
two two and a half would I would say below 3% but whatever it is two and a half and 3% and then you take the long rate it's
10:18
about 200 basis points so that brings you up in the vicinity the bond yield in
10:24
the vicinity of a a a 5% 4 and a half and 5% level given uh a normal
10:31
equilibrium I think there's a strong tendency to believe that the yield curve should be um positive I think that if
10:40
they um and eventually it'll settle out to be positive but if you're looking at
10:45
then the existing level of inflation it certainly um is not at Target and they
10:51
they will ease up on that Target they will probably accept an inflation rate
10:57
at two and a half to 3% uh but you as as as you bring that up and then you look
11:03
at uh the existing uh conditions the existing uh stress levels that exist in
11:11
the form of the economy the form of the markets form of credit spreads and so on
11:18
um and you say uh this is uh definitely too easy what's wrong with the existing
11:25
monetary policy the existing term structure of interest rates in terms of
11:30
uh growth and inflation is growth and and infl inflation such that uh growth
11:36
is too low and inflation is too low and that you should have a stimula monetary policy that is under the normal set of
11:44
circumstances if we now say then what are the risks to those scenarios um I I
11:50
would say the risks are of significantly higher um I issues of inflation and so
11:57
on for uh for issues pertaining to the political issues and that we'll probably
12:03
get into that but how tariffs Will Rise um how other things will take place the
12:09
and what's going on geopolitically creates another risk and then there's the supply demand so when I look at the
12:16
bond market I think the Bond Market um is at a at a around these levels um a
12:25
appropriately uh priced in that vicinity of and a half I think probably longer
12:30
term it's not going to that's too low um and then if I take the slope of the
12:36
yield curve and where the short rates are and where the existing rates of inflation are and so on I think that
12:42
that's o operating uh well so yet there's a 200 basis point easing and we
12:48
still have the big budget deficit um and current account deficit uh issues going
12:55
on let's explore inflation a bit more focusing on the fiscal policy side Ray
13:01
you've made the point that politically neither of the presidential candidates has an incentive to reign in spending
13:07
the Biden Administration doesn't want to see too much of a constraint going into the election and it really doesn't appear that Trump and his people really
13:13
want to spend less either so I think the picture you're painting here is a hotter inflationary environment than currently
13:20
priced in the interest rate markets can you walk us through how you're thinking about that well there's two issues
13:28
there's first the inflation rate and second there is the supply demand for
13:33
the bonds if I'm looking at the inflation rate um and I look at the poor levels
13:43
particularly income levels um spending levels and then um and and then I um I I
13:52
I come up with I don't know let I come up with about 3% it's two and a half I
13:57
don't really know the difference so I I'm happy to say that by any measure we are not at the 2% targeted so
14:07
we're above that and current one would say is in that vicinity that's not much
14:14
of a disputable question and then you could add on uh what you know what what
14:19
I said about rates before as we go forward in terms of the supply demand
14:25
issue we know that we're going to have a lot more Supply yeah I'm talking about
14:32
money supply and money before we get to supplying of stuff so um on the supply
14:38
of money um uh uh what we know is um
14:43
that there is not going to be any Remediation in fact there is going to
14:49
have to be increase in spending and if you take where the geopolitical
14:54
situation is not only internally but I said geopolitical in internationally and
15:00
you look at what for example the defense budget is okay it's a 1% increase in the
15:07
in the budget which is a negative real um decrease um that is a pressing issue
15:14
that people on both sides uh recognize and um they don't want to talk about it
15:20
right now in terms of that issue but that's not going to be a sustainable amount that we're um in the world and
15:28
then if you then take into consideration the climate issue the climate issue one
15:33
way or another that's estimated to be about 8 trillion dollars a year which is
15:38
required and we're not going to spend that we're spending about one sixth of that which means also one of the reasons
15:45
we're not anywhere near approaching holding temperature increases at one and a half degrees be because but anyway
15:52
it's um that that's 8% of world GDP there's a lot of spending and then there's the north south South issue
15:59
um and and then we're looking at the world and you say who's going to afford
16:05
these various things you look at Europe and and you know okay we say Europe
16:11
should take care of its defense in in terms of those things well Europe has its own issues and so on so what we have
16:19
is um the need or more the demands for higher am amounts of spending that are
16:26
even put into that budget and those budgets so the risks of those are on the
16:31
upside and if you just take what is projected and then you apply The Debt
16:37
Service payments to that the maturity of the debt and the amount of interest
16:43
payments that has to be on that debt that is creating a classic squeeze in
16:48
other words I've seen this repeatedly happen throughout countries and this this financial this is not sound strong
16:56
finances in which there's a good statement in a balance sheet so the value of debt assets is a function of
17:05
these types of things and so um as we come into a world also of greater
17:10
conflict the um it's has to be recognized that a debt asset is a risky
17:18
asset to hold because conflicts themselves create greater needs and then
17:23
there's also a settlement problem in terms of what is the asset that is exchangeable around the world if you
17:30
study markets during Wars and I've studied markets during Wars um allies
17:36
don't accept each other's money right because of the fact that that money that
17:41
debt that they'll take on they know that country is going to get into more debt and probably have to monetize the debt
17:48
and they don't even know what will happen at the uh end of that so the risks literally of holding money debt
17:56
debt assets during Wars or different types uh assets during Wars are are high and
18:02
lurk in the back not to mention then the issues pertaining to the uh possibility
18:10
possibility of unacceptable disruptions in supply lines let me explore a couple
18:16
a couple of things you you said so this sort of demand Supply mismatch for us
18:22
paper or for that matter many governments around the world so this is a threat to to to uh fiat currency this
18:28
is basically what you're you're raising you've been talking about this for a while you know we do see gold for
18:34
example making new nominal highs we do see Bitcoin U making uh highs I mean part of that is structural in terms of
18:40
the development of an ETF but still the demand is uh is there I would presume
18:45
that given what you're saying you would say that those market dynamics that we're seeing right now are not
18:51
surprising no I let me step back and say that the most important thing that
18:58
everybody should start with is a balanced portfolio the up until now
19:04
we've been talking about what might happen Okay but if you put aside the
19:10
uncertainties of the supply demand and such things and you think about what is
19:16
a balanced portfolio what are my risks so that I have
19:22
symmetrical uh risks so that I can go through any environment one would have
19:28
greater amounts of those assets uh inflation hedge assets that are the type
19:34
of money okay so let me just pause on that for let's say gold um Bitcoin is a
19:42
another topic but it's a related topic uh money that I can go from one place to
19:49
another with and it's accepted around the world it's accepted by central banks
19:56
today by the way gold is the third largest reserve after dollars and Euro
20:02
and so it's a money that's accepted and um as the say goes it's a it's a it's an
20:08
asset that is not somebody else's liability other ones you're depending on
20:14
getting paid this one you're not depending on possession you know is the
20:20
law in essentially and um it has uh a negative Co correlation significant
20:27
negative Cor coration with the top of the typical portfolios which have a lot of equity
20:34
beta in them but Equity or Bond beta it has if you take any of the major
20:40
crisises you see that that movement out of money in that sort of way cause a
20:46
spike in gold and that if you take a portfolio Optimizer and you were to say
20:53
what if I was to Overlay gold in my portfolio added
20:59
it would reduce the risk and increase the expected return if you add that into
21:05
a portfolio so the issue is at this time given all the sets of
21:14
circumstances why wouldn't you move to a more balanced portfolio why wouldn't you
21:19
do those exercises in order to consider that now let's move to the internal
Chapter 3: The Internal Conflict Force and the US Election
21:25
conflict Force you know we have elections approaching all over the world
21:30
including probably the most consequential election right here in the United States and on the presidential level and it's shaping up to be a rerun
21:37
of the last one you've been very vocal on the dangers you see in the polarization in the United States and
21:43
elsewhere so I'm wondering if you can give us your thoughts on how you're seeing the internal conflict Force particularly as it pertains to the US
21:50
and what the consequences could be of either Republican or a Democratic Victory when I did the
21:57
study uh it was like watching them the movie over and over again uh there
22:02
there's this movie that happens and and what it is is when there are big wealth
22:07
and values gaps and um you have populism which
22:13
means uh that people get fed up of not having their own needs taken care of and
22:21
they reject this the that old political
22:26
system that doesn't deliver for them then you have irreconcilable differences
22:34
in which you have to pick aide and fight and then that calls into question
22:41
the system and whether the system is fair is the legal system fair is the
22:47
Supreme Court Fair or has it been corrupted by the politicalization is the
22:55
media balanced and so on the and are are we working to
23:00
compromise and to or are we having irreconcilable voting blocks and
23:06
decision blocks that means it's black and white and you have to get on one side or the other and we haven't seen
23:14
that in our lifetimes before and so when I wrote the book everybody thought it was crazy this was before there was
23:21
January 6th but I've seen this happen repeatedly there's a cycle and there's a
23:26
norm for that and that is what we are in so when we look at the upcoming
23:33
elections the first questions that we ask ourselves is is this election going
23:39
to progress normally and then if the election progresses normally where will
23:44
that lead us because of how the different sides have different views and
23:50
how will they work together to achieve results so in other words politics is normal so we have some reasonable ly
23:59
concerning issue that you may not have an acceptance of the outcome in that
24:07
normal way we are getting to the point that it is conceivable that they will
24:13
not be an acceptance and you get a civil warish type of reaction I know my words
24:20
are evocative I don't mean them to be evocative but it could very well be that
24:25
the states do not listen to the Federal government on decisions that they say no
24:31
make me and then you have a breakdown of that kind of a system and I know that
24:37
this sounds evocative to to most people but if you read history and you see
24:42
what's happening that has to be considered as a possibility as we look at these types of Elections um it's
24:50
certainly the case if you have an election and it progresses normally
24:55
let's say and Donald Trump is elected which by the way might mean less of a
25:01
risk of the fight because the Democrats might accept that I they may not accept the policies I think you're going to
25:08
likely have the politicalization of the government in other words we know that there's a plan
25:15
underway to take many civil servants and get rid of those civil servants and to
25:21
replace those that who are on his side and that there is a movement now like
25:27
you're you're with him or you're against him and and think about the consequences
25:33
of that and so there's that element of the dynamic which is a reality I'm not
25:39
making this up okay so how does government work it's more going to be do
25:44
you have more Congressional investigations for political reasons now
25:51
let's assume that that's all not a problem and everything runs smoothly then we can go on to what the policies
25:58
are and Donald Trump's policies are going to be more nationalistic
26:05
isolationist free markets more uh more capitalist um and so on and that'll have
26:13
consequences that'll have consequences in inflation trade and world affairs
26:20
because geopolitical part of the world affairs means that the United States
26:25
will not be the same kind of Ally but nor will it have to have the associated
26:32
expenses of being the same kind of Ally but it will then start to produce
26:37
consequences geopolitical consequences as there is a retrenching from some of the war
26:45
areas so now let's contemplate if Joe Biden is elected you're probably not
26:51
going to have Joe Biden because um he probably will not be in the condition at
26:56
least this is popular thinking that he probably will not be in the condition um
27:01
to be the president all through that that particular term and so and and
27:07
there's some question of course as to whether Trump would be too but more so uh Biden and and so when there's the
27:14
election there is the question of uh what is a democratic Pro policy what
27:20
what will the Democrat the Democrats are split there are moderate Democrats and
27:26
then there are extreme Democrats in other words extreme leftist de Democrats
27:33
that would um arrange big um transfers of wealth our country is not in good
27:39
shape in other words if you look at the financial condition the infrastructure
27:45
the education um and those types of things uh we're in a hole we and so by being in
27:53
a hole um it's not like um somebody isn't going to pay and those who will
27:59
pay will be uh the rich and the uh corporations so now you start to think
28:05
about what does that mean for cor corporate taxes and what does that mean for markets so when we think about that
28:12
we remember uh what it meant uh when Donald Trump got elected the number one thing is what is the you know the stock
28:19
is worth it it's after tax net cash prison value that's net cash flows and
28:27
so if taxes go up that is like interest rates going up it's a it's a negative on
28:34
uh the markets and so on and it also can produce conflict you might see and I
28:40
would say you're likely to see greater polarity in um in the decision making
28:46
and having unreconcilable differences there are differences these differences aren't just about people's money which
28:53
they care a lot about these differences are also about values so there are
28:59
irreconcilable differences that seems to me makes the uh political situation in
29:05
the United States uh an important situation and when I relate it to the other forces the the financial force or
29:13
I related to the geopolitical force it's more threatening because geopolitically
29:20
other countries are probably going to take advantage of what is happening in the United States on the extr interal
Chapter 4: The External Conflict Force
29:29
Conflict for us I'm wondering where you think we stand and what the future holds
29:34
we've we've got a stalemate that maybe Russia is winning that stalemate in the Russia Ukraine war and there's a lack of
29:41
funding willingness on the part of the West particularly the United States and then we also have the conflict that
29:47
simmers underneath the surface it's not a hot conflict but the Taiwan issue and China Taiwan and of course the other
29:55
conflicts uh going on so when when you look at this are these top of mind and
30:00
do you think that any of them are particularly going to become more acute
30:05
in some way that would raise risk premiums looking out over the course of this year and into next or are they sort
30:12
of stable for the moment in your view and um not top of mind uh because there
30:18
are other factors that are that that that are affecting what's going on um I think that uh it's less
30:25
important to look at everything through the wars and the conflicts that are happening as much as you're looking you
30:33
should look at the allies and the dynamic that is behind
30:39
that okay so both are going on there is a local conflict between in the Middle
30:46
East Israel Gaza or or the Hamas Palestinians
30:52
and then other Regional entities and there is a uh certainly a Russia
30:58
Ukraine but um you have to keep in mind that there's that's a manifestation to a
31:05
large extent of a greater conflict that has to do with um Associated common
31:12
interests uh regarding the powers that be in the world such as a China Russia
31:20
Iran and so when we look at that in that way we we're seeing both sides play out
31:28
so you're seeing for example the money and support
31:33
test in other words Europe and the United States okay how much money will you put
31:41
into it and how much support will you put into it becomes um a
31:47
test and we know the consequences of that and that test we it also
31:54
means um it's a draw down of resources um in other words literally our capacity
32:02
to produce military equipment and the inventories of Mi military equipment are
32:10
depleted and even the modernization of military equipment is depleted and
32:16
that's a fact and that's a fact globally and it's also a relevant flat fact
32:23
because of um the fact very classically in the great Empire
32:28
at the stage in the cycle they are overextended because they have
32:33
militaries all around the world the United States has militaries in 80 countries and um those
32:41
originally um those presences in other countries were
32:46
profitable that's what the empire did they they made them profitable and they were profitable well they they can
32:52
become very unprofitable and so when we look at these issues it also becomes a political
32:59
issue domestically as to what is the United States's position not only an
33:05
economic question but will what wars will the United States fight okay what
33:12
will you lose people will you lose unacceptably in different locations in
33:19
that that may be in Europe or um in Middle East or it may be in Asia and
33:26
that is an issue that's a geopolitical game issue before we move on from the
Chapter 5: Assessing What’s Happening in China
33:32
external conflict Force I want to zoom in on China because Ray you just wrote a new daily observations and it was titled
33:38
in China the hundred-year storm on the horizon and how the five big forces are playing out in that piece you describe
33:45
what's currently happening in China both economically and otherwise in the context of what has transpired over the
33:51
past Century we'll link to that piece here but I'm wondering if you could just share with our listeners how you're
33:58
seeing China today in terms of its trajectory its leadership and of course the power conflict with the
34:04
US Chinese are culturally they've had
34:09
you know many thousands of years of um civilization and it meaning it's like
34:15
watching the movies over and over again the Rises and declines of dynasties and there's a cycle and I think they kind of
34:23
understand where they are in that cycle and then there's the basic thing to know
34:30
about it is that um be strong be
34:36
powerful um and if you're strong and powerful that will determine your
34:42
position and know how to play your position and it's very much an extension
34:49
of confusion ISM which is an extension of the family and hierarchy so you know
34:54
your position your position means that if you're in a position power that you behave in a certain way
35:01
with those of lesser power and they call that the tribute system uh in other
35:07
words the one who has lesser power should respect those with has greater
35:13
power and those with greater power should be treat those with lesser power
35:19
well and you never want to occupy a country and and make it do the things it
35:28
doesn't want to do those policies never work you're not going to occupy and make
35:34
a people operate by a religion or a way that they they don't want to operate by
35:39
that that's a force against nature that what you want to do is is find out well
35:44
what do you want from them and what do they want from you and have good trading
35:50
relations with them and so on and to more I would suppose manipulate them or
35:57
um operate that way and so when we're applying it to the ex existing set of
36:03
circumstances it is um in their minds um natural and admirable that their power
36:11
increased as it it did that you know since I started going there 19 uh 84 per
36:18
capita incomes increased by 29 times and and life expectancy is greater than 10
36:24
years greater and poverty rates of like being hungry went from 88% to less than
36:30
1% and it's been quite a remarkable Arc and that then there are these things
36:38
like the big cycle that I'm talking about in terms of now we're they're at a
36:44
different phase in the big cycle where what happens is you're not going to have the same growth and then you have a debt
36:51
crisis and then you have uh the great power conflict so you no longer can hide
36:58
your power so now you're a threat now you have the dynamic and the question is how do you play that Dynamic I urge the
37:06
people to read the piece that I wrote which describes then how that's
37:11
operating he is now operating she is operating much more in a Le what's
37:16
called In traditional history of of that illegalist way which is um a very strict
37:23
Behavior way with a uh Marxist M Mayo um type of overcome what that means it
37:31
it should be understood so they view it as the United States is a declining
37:38
power that is trying to contain it and then uh there's the associated rivalry
37:46
uh with that so now of course both countries have they have um these
37:53
domestic issues the domestic issues I would I would say is whether they res whether they operate
38:01
in a way that they have an economically lost decade with a let's let's say a
38:07
maoist Marxist tilt or whether they do a big
38:13
restructuring a debt restructuring and so on is going to be in their court and it's a greater risk that they will have
38:20
that if they have that that I think that their basic view of that is that it's
38:27
the disruptive and undesirable but it's not going to bring them to where they
38:32
were before and that the population uh which can be spoiled and
38:39
corrupt in their view um has got to get in shape uh because we have to prepare
38:47
they would say that we have to prepare for the hundred-year storm on the horizon so I would say I would describe
38:54
the perspective as being uh along Ong those lines and I would say um the same
39:01
issues are existing in in their various ways in the United States we talked about the United States and they're I
39:08
think um describing it as there's a 100-year storm on the horizon which by
39:14
the way brings us back if you go back a hundred years that's U you know you go back 90 years you're probably that's
39:21
where you are um and so I think that that's the perspective and the only way
39:27
that you handle that well is to be uh strong so to do the right things to
39:33
bring the populations together and to be productive and strong um that is be what
39:40
will determine how these things transpire in the end and um also to be
39:46
able to compromise rather than to destroy the other so Ry as we hit the
Chapter 6: AI and Climate Considerations
39:54
two other forces one of one of them is of course course productivity and new invention and human inventiveness and
40:02
this is something you've been looking at carefully so walk us through a little bit how you're thinking about uh Ai and
40:09
and and a and a potential productivity miracle and what it would look like through history we have seen um that the
40:17
human has evolved almost with their body parts different body parts from the
40:23
bottom up um being replaced by machines um so in the agricultural age the uh
40:30
human was uh like oxen and then we had tractors and and then in the industrial
40:37
revolution we had machines that would replace that and then increasingly we
40:42
had Ai and there's been a continuous process of its uh Evolution that has uh
40:49
been essential to my personal and Bridgewater's development um over that
40:56
period of time which we went through um using expert systems um to develop that
41:04
and um now um there is the generative Ai and lar language models which is a
41:10
tremendous tool that uh will accelerate that and so I could say you know without
41:17
a doubt that it will be a fabulous tool in all dimensions and will be in
41:24
investing so along those lines it is going to be a tremendously
41:32
transformative influence and and we're just talking about AI um when we take
41:38
other technologies that are also U transformative so that has to do with
41:45
everything from Quantum Computing to um
41:50
um uh genetic sequencing to um studying
41:55
the Imaging of the body um at a molecular level um and um so many
42:04
different forms new energy sources um and and so many different
42:10
things the technologies that are accelerating because the brain is being um
42:18
significantly improved when you increase your muscles the power of your muscles
42:23
with tractors and um other things um and that's one thing but when you increase
42:29
the power of the mind to invent and to deal with things automatically that's a
42:35
whole different level of advancement and that's what we're seeing so I think if I
42:42
take these five big forces that we're talking about um and I look out I count
42:48
out one year two years I think that in 3 to five years it's like it's going to be
42:54
like going through a Time Warp where going to see a radically different world
43:01
that these things are going to come to a head they're things that we're all talking about and then in this AI world
43:07
so the world is going to be a very very different world in the future and then I
43:12
take climate which we just touched on but we really didn't get into climate is
43:19
going to have a a big effect um in in lots of different ways droughts floods
43:25
and pandemics have throughout history as I said have this huge effect and so
43:31
we're going to experience that we're going to it's going to cost us a lot of money and then it has implications
43:38
because it has implications on world Water Supplies temperatures uh in which
43:45
will lead to migrations of people it'll change economic behaviors in a lot of
43:51
different ways these things are all happening and so um I I I I think when
43:57
we step back and we look at all of that we can say these big things are
44:03
happening there are lessons from the past that we could learn and at the same
44:08
time we mustn't be arrogant in thinking that we can anticipate well all the
44:16
convergence of those things and we have to think how do we structure a portfolio
44:21
well so that regardless of what happens we're going to be okay
44:27
Ray thank you so much for your time I love doing this with you and I look
44:33
forward in several months to sitting down again and doing it all over again to to hear your thoughts on the five
44:39
forces so thank you so much my pleasure we hope you enjoyed the discussion and
44:45
look forward to engaging with you more on our latest research through the Bridgewater daily observations we also
44:51
encourage you to rate and comment on today's episode your feedback helps us to improve and it helps us to answer
44:58
your most important investment questions thank you very much for additional
45:03
information and other important disclosures please see the full disclosures at the bottom of today's
