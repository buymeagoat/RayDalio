You'll now see the full table of contents on screen, offering a clear overview of the book's structure. Let's
0:31
begin. Chapter 2, the determinance. In the last chapter, I
Chapter 2: The Determinants
0:38
described the big cycle in a tiny nutshell. In this and other chapters that follow in part one, I will flesh
0:44
out how I see the perpetual motion machine working. In this chapter, I will review the most important determinants
0:51
and summarize how I put them into my model. As the saying goes and most people
0:57
agree, history rhymes. It rhymes because its most important events repeat, though
1:03
never in exactly the same way. That is because while the cause effect relationships behind those events are
1:09
timeless and universal, all things evolve and influence each other in different ways. By studying many
1:16
analogous events and different times and places, their underlying causes and effects become clearer. I have learned
1:23
that history's continuously evolving story transpires like a perpetual motion machine that is driven by cause effect
1:30
relationships that both evolve and repeat over time. To deal with the realities that
1:37
are coming at me, my process is to interact with this machine and try to
1:42
understand how it works. Write down my observations of its workings along with
1:48
the principles I have learned for dealing with them. Back test those principles through time.
1:54
Convert the principles into equations and program them into a computer that helps me with my
2:00
decision-m. Learn from my experiences and my reflections on my experiences so
2:05
I can refine my principles. Do that over and over again.
2:11
Imagine a chess player who records their criteria for making different moves in
2:16
different situations, which they then encode into a computer that plays alongside them like a partner. Each
2:23
player brings what they are best at to the game. The human player is more inventive, more lateral in thinking, and
2:30
better able to reason, while the computer can calculate more data faster, is better able to identify patterns, and
2:37
is much less emotional. This neverending process of learning, building, using,
2:43
and refining in partnership with computers describes what I do. Except my
2:49
game is global macro investing, not chess. In this chapter, I will share my
2:56
description of the workings of the perpetual motion machine that drives the rises and declines of empires and their
3:02
reserve currencies as I have come to understand it thus far, giving you a glimpse into how I play my game.
3:09
While I'm sure my mental model is wrong and incomplete in any number of ways, it
3:15
is the best one that I have now and it has proven invaluable to me. I am
3:20
passing it along for you to probe and explore, take or leave and build on as you like. My hope is that I will prompt
3:27
you and others to think about the timeless and universal cause effect relationships that drive the realities
3:33
that are coming at us and the best principles for dealing with them. By stress testing and improving this model
3:40
through fullthroatated debate, we will get to the point where we have a largely agreed upon template of the processes
3:47
and their causes. By using that template, we can then strive to agree on
3:53
which stage each country is in and what the best practices are for interacting with it. Whether we are individuals
3:59
taking care of our own interests or we are leaders taking care of our countries.
4:05
In the last chapter, I conveyed a very simplified description of the determinance of the evolution and
4:10
cyclical rises and declines of empires. Most importantly, what I believe to be the primary drivers of the big cycles.
4:18
In this chapter, I will explain the model in much greater detail. It is based on what I saw happen repeatedly
4:25
through time in the 11 leading empires of the last 500 years, the 20 most
4:30
important countries of the last 100 years, and the major dynasties of China over the last 1,400 years. To be clear,
4:39
I do not consider myself to be an expert historian in these cases, and these cases represent only a small percentage
4:45
of all cases. I only glanced at some of the most important empires in early
4:50
history such as the Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Byzantine, Mongol, Han, Sui,
4:57
Arab, and Persian empires. And I completely neglected many of the other empires that have risen and declined
5:04
throughout the world in Africa, South Asia, the Pacific Islands, and pre-colonial North and South America. In
5:11
other words, what I didn't examine was much greater than what I did examine. Still, I believe I have seen enough to
5:18
develop a good mental model that applies to most countries, which has been very helpful to my efforts to understand what
5:25
is going on today and which helps me to form a valuable though hazy picture of
5:30
the future. The construction of my mental model of the perpetual motion
5:38
machine. Just as we can see the arc of the human life cycle from birth to death
5:43
and how one generation impacts the next, we can do the same with countries and empires, we can see how values, assets,
5:51
liabilities, and experiences are handed down and how their evolutionary effects ripple out across the
5:58
generations. We can tell when an empire is approaching its peak and when it is in decline.
6:04
All peoples throughout history have had systems or orders for governing how they deal with each other. I call the systems
6:11
within countries internal orders, those between countries external orders, and
6:17
those that apply to the whole world orders. These orders affect each other
6:23
and are always changing. Such orders have always existed at every level within families,
6:29
companies, cities, states, and countries as well as internationally. They determine who has what powers and
6:36
how decisions are made, including how wealth and political control are divided. What they are and how they run
6:44
is a function of human nature, culture, and circumstances. The US now has a certain
6:50
set of existing political conditions within its democratic system. But both the conditions and the system are ever
6:57
changing because of the pressure of timeless and universal forces.
7:02
The way I see it at any moment in time there are both one the existing set of
7:07
conditions that include the existing domestic and world orders and two
7:12
timeless and universal forces that cause changes in these conditions. Most people tend to pay too
7:19
much attention to what exists relative to the timeless and universal forces that produce the changes. I do the
7:26
opposite in my attempt to anticipate change. Everything that has happened and
7:31
everything that will happen has had and will have determinants that make it happen. If we can understand those
7:39
determinants, we can understand how the machine works and anticipate what will likely be coming at us
7:46
next. Since everything that happened and will happen was and is due to the
7:51
interactions of the parts of this perpetual motion machine, one can say that everything is predestined.
7:58
I believe that if we had a perfect model that took every cause effect relationship into consideration, we
8:05
could perfectly forecast the future that the only thing that stands in the way is
8:10
our inability to model all those cause effect dynamics. While that might or might not
8:16
be right, it tells you where I'm coming from and what I'm striving for. Most people don't see things that
8:24
way. Most people believe the future is unknowable and that destiny doesn't exist. To be clear, while having a
8:31
perfect model that gives a nearly perfect picture of that predestined future would be great, I don't expect my
8:38
model to come close to that. My goal is simply to have a crude yet evolving
8:43
model that gives me a leg up relative to the competition and relative to the position I would be in if I didn't have
8:50
the model. To build this model, I looked at history quantitatively as well as
8:56
qualitatively because one, by measuring conditions and their changes, I can more
9:01
objectively determine the cause effect relationships behind them, develop a likely range of expectations and
9:08
systemize my decision-m accordingly, but two, I can't measure everything
9:13
quantitatively. My process is to look at many cases to
9:18
observe how their determinants created the effects that define them. To give a simple example, a lot of debt, a
9:26
determinant, together with tight money, another determinant, will typically produce a debt crisis. the effect.
9:34
Similarly, when the three big cycles that I described in the last chapter come together in a bad way, heavy
9:40
indebtedness with the central bank printing a lot of money, internal conflict stemming from gaps in wealth,
9:47
values, and politics, and the rise of one or more competing powers that typically leads to the decline of an
9:54
incumbent empire. In my mental model, the relationship between the determinants and their
10:00
effects in the various cases looks like the PDF titled How the Machine
10:06
Works. Determinants lead to effects that become subsequent determinants that produce subsequent effects that become
10:13
linked together in many cases. So, we can look at each case and see what happened, the effect, and what made it
10:20
happen, its determinance. Or we can look at the determinants to see the effects they had to make up the various cases.
10:28
The determinants are both what exists and the energy that produces changes.
10:33
Like energy and matter, at the end of the day, they're the same. They create new circumstances and new determinants
10:40
that create the next changes. That is how I quite literally try to model the perpetual motion
10:49
machine. the three, the five, the eight, and the 18
10:55
determinants. In the last chapter, I introduced you to what I believe are the three big cycles and the eight most
11:02
important determinants of the rises and declines of empires and their currencies. Because thinking about all
11:08
of these determinants and their interactions is complex, I suggest that you keep the three big cycles in mind as
11:15
the most important things to watch. One, the cycle of good and bad finances,
11:21
for example, the capital market cycle. Two, the cycle of internal order and
11:26
disorder due to degrees of cooperation and fighting over wealth and power largely caused by wealth and values
11:34
gaps. And three, the cycle of external order and disorder due to the degrees of
11:39
the competitiveness of existing powers in fighting for wealth and power. I hope
11:45
you will join me in trying to understand these three cycles and know where countries are in them. History and logic
11:51
show that when a country simultaneously has all three in their good phases, it is strong and rising. And when all three
11:58
are in their bad phases, it is weak and declining. If I were to add two more determinants
12:05
to keep in mind, they would be four, the pace of innovation and technological development to solve problems and make
12:12
improvements and five acts of nature, most importantly droughts, floods, and
12:18
diseases. That is because innovation and technological advances can solve most
12:23
problems and further evolution. and acts of nature such as droughts, floods and
12:29
diseases have had enormous impacts throughout history. These are the five
12:34
most important forces which I call the big five. So when they are moving in the same direction toward improving or
12:41
toward worsening, most everything else follows. I also introduced the eight
12:47
powers that I could measure that seemed to be the most important. You can review them along with the big cycles in the
12:53
next PDF. These indicators both reflect and drive the upswings and down swings.
13:00
The chart of the archetypical rise and decline by factor in chapter 1 showed
13:05
the average readings of these along the path of the archetypical cycle. Each of
13:10
these types of power rising and declining in cycles comes together with the other cycles to make the one big
13:17
cycle of the empire's rise and decline. And then there are the other
13:22
determinants such as geology, geography, rule of law, and infrastructure that
13:28
matter too. The whole list of 18 factors included in my model is shown on the
13:34
next PDF. You can also hear a detailed description of all 18 at the end of
13:40
chapter 14. I want to clarify the difference between a determinant and a cycle because
13:46
sometimes I will use these terms in ways that might not be clear. A determinant
13:51
is a factor, for example, the supply of money, while a cycle is a series of
13:56
self-reinforcing determinants that lead to events transpiring in a certain way.
14:01
For example, central banks making lots of money and credit available eventually leads to strong economic growth,
14:09
inflation and bubbles which then prompt central banks to reduce the money supply which produces market and economic
14:16
downturns which then lead the central banks to increase the supply of money to
14:21
etc. So cycles themselves are determinants that are a collection of
14:26
complimentary forces that interact in a process to produce the same results again and again through
14:32
time. I find measuring and weighing all these things in my head plus all of the
14:38
other important dynamics at play to be impossible. That is why I analyze them
14:43
with the aid of a computer. I will share my analysis for the top 11 countries in
14:48
the appendix after chapter 14. the future. I also provide detail on some
14:55
components for the top 20 countries at
15:00
economicprinciples.org. Though none of these determinants is determinative on its own, I think you will find that when
15:06
considered together, they paint a pretty clear picture of which part of its life cycle a country is in and the direction
15:13
it is headed in. For the fun of it, you might want to go through a little exercise of ticking off where each of
15:19
those measures is for each country you're interested in. Rank each country on a 1 to 10 scale for each attribute,
15:26
beginning with 10 on the far left and one on the far right. If you add all
15:32
these rankings up, the higher the number, the greater the probability of the country rising on a relative basis.
15:38
The lower the number, the more likely it will fall. Take a moment to calculate
15:43
where the United States is, where China is, where Italy is, where Brazil is, and
15:49
so on. Because I systematize as much as I can, I push to quantify whatever
15:56
possible into a decision-making system. So, with the help of my team, I have
16:01
developed gauges that look at things like internal and external conflict, political gaps, etc. to help me better
16:08
understand where countries are in their cycles. Some of the less key determinants are aggregated as
16:14
subcomponents of the key determinants. While I measure and describe the determinants discreetly,
16:21
they are not separate. They interact with each other and blend together typically reinforcing each other and the
16:28
whole cycles rise and fall. For example, stronger education leads to stronger
16:33
technological innovation, which leads to increased productivity and increased shares of trade, greater wealth, more
16:40
military power, and eventually the establishment of a reserve currency. Further, having strong
16:46
leaders, a population that is well educated and civil with each other, a system that efficiently allocates
16:53
capital and other resources, access to natural resources, and favorable geography all help a lot. And when they
17:00
decline, they tend to decline together. Of course, not all of the
17:05
indicators can be expressed in numbers and equations. Things like human nature and the power dynamics that affect
17:12
behaviors and outcomes are better described in words. I call these things
17:18
dynamics. The next PDF table shows a list of other main dynamics that I keep
17:23
in my head while trying to evaluate where nations are and what is likely to come next.
17:29
That's a lot. It is both too little and too much. Too little to do full justice
17:36
to the subjects which have all been the focus of whole books and doctoral thesis
17:41
and too much to process and digest. I've tried to cram a small portion of what I've learned about them
17:48
into the summaries that follow. The fuller accounts of a number of these dynamics are contained in an addendum
17:55
immediately following this chapter if you're interested in diving more deeply into any of them. While I'm sure that
18:01
what follows doesn't include all the most important determinants, I also know
18:06
that the ones I'm highlighting here and in the following chapters represent the most important influences that have
18:13
repeatedly driven the most important events throughout history. Of course, I
18:18
look forward to being corrected and guided by others to make my descriptions more
18:25
complete. Exploring the determinance and dynamics. I find that knowing the
18:31
different circumstances countries face as well as the strategies and group dynamics they bring to facing these
18:38
circumstances helps me understand what moves are likely to come next and how these moves will impact the key
18:45
determinants. I will explain a bit more about how these look to me, which I will do by examining the machine from the top
18:53
down. As I see it, the determinants and dynamics that drive events fall into two
19:00
types. One, inherited determinance. They include a country's geography, geology,
19:07
and acts of nature such as weather and diseases. Two, human capital
19:13
determinance. They are the ways people are with themselves and each other. They
19:18
are driven by human nature and different cultures which differentiate their
19:24
approaches. These two big categories contain within them many important factors ranging from qualities that are
19:31
highly specific to countries like their geography to those that are universal like the human tendency to favor
19:38
short-term gratification over long-term goals. and they can be discerned at every level whether in individuals,
19:45
cities, countries, or empires. Inherited
19:52
determinance. By inherited determinance of a country's well-being, I mean its geography, geology, genealogy, and acts
20:00
of nature. These are big drivers of each country's and each people's stories. For
20:06
example, you can't understand the success of the United States without recognizing that it is separated from
20:11
European and Asian powers by two oceans and blessed with most of the minerals, metals, and other natural resources it
20:19
needs to be prosperous and self-sufficient, including the top soil, water, and temperate climate that allows
20:25
it to produce most of its own food. These factors enabled it to be largely
20:30
isolationist until a little more than a century ago. while investing in education, infrastructure, and
20:36
innovation in ways that made it strong. Let's briefly review
20:41
those. One, geography. Where a country is, what's around it, and what its
20:48
terrain is like are all important determinants. For example, the geographies of the
20:53
United States and China, both with large expanses of land bounded by large natural barriers of water and mountains,
21:00
created the inclination for them to be one big hole, increasing the commonalities of their people, for
21:07
example, shared language, government, culture, etc. In contrast, the geography of Europe
21:13
having many more natural boundaries within it reinforced its divisions into different states and countries leading
21:20
to fewer commonalities among its people. For example, different languages, governments, cultures,
21:27
etc. Two, geology. The natural resources on and
21:32
under a country's surface are critically important, but geology should not be overvalued relative to human capital.
21:40
History shows us that every commodity has declined in value in inflationadjusted terms with big up and
21:47
down cycles around that downtrend. That is because inventiveness
21:53
changes what is in demand. For example, new energy sources replacing old ones,
21:58
fiber optic cable replacing copper wiring, etc. And natural resources are
22:04
depleted over time. Many Middle Eastern countries wealth, power and relevance to the rest of the
22:10
world rose with the importance of petroleum and may fall as the world turns away from fossil fuels. The most
22:18
vulnerable position to be in is having a high reliance on one or a few
22:23
commodities because they are highly cyclical and sometimes lose value
22:29
altogether. Three, acts of nature. Acts of nature come in many forms such
22:36
as epidemic diseases, floods, and droughts. Throughout history, they have
22:41
affected the well-being of countries and the course of their evolution even more than wars and depressions. The Black
22:48
Death killed an estimated 75 to 200 million people in the years around
22:54
1350. And smallox killed more than 300 million people in the 20th century,
23:00
which is more than double the number that died in its wars. Droughts and floods have caused massive
23:06
famines and loss of life. Such catastrophes tend to come along unexpectedly and act as stress tests
23:13
revealing the underlying strengths and weaknesses of societies. Four, genealogy.
23:21
[Music] Regarding genealogy, I'm no expert on genetics. So I have little to offer
23:27
other than to say that all people come into this world with inherited genes that affect how they behave to some
23:33
extent. So it is logical that the genetic makeup of a country's population should have some effect on its outcomes.
23:41
Having said that, I should point out that most of the evidence I have seen indicates that only a small percentage,
23:47
15% or less of the variations in the behaviors of people between populations
23:53
could potentially be explained by genetic differences. So, genetics seems to be a relatively minor determinant in
23:59
relation to the other influences I'm [Music] mentioning. Human capital
24:07
determinance. While the inherited assets and liabilities of a country are very important, history has shown that the
24:14
way people are with themselves and others is the most important determinant. By that I mean whether they
24:21
hold themselves to high standards of behavior, whether they are self-disciplined and whether they are civil with others in order to be
24:28
productive members of their societies is most important. These qualities plus flexibility and
24:34
resilience that is the capacity to adapt to both bad and good things allows
24:41
people to minimize setbacks and maximize opportunities. Character, common sense,
24:47
creativity and consideration in most people make for a productive
24:53
society. Because capital is an income prodducing asset, human capital can be
24:59
defined as a human who generates income. When humans have the capacity to produce
25:05
more revenue than they expend, there is good human capital and self-sufficiency. I call this
25:11
self-sufficient plus, which is what all people, companies, and countries should strive for in order for them
25:18
individually and collectively to be strong financially. The likelihood of having good human
25:24
capital and being self-sufficient plus is improved through quality education, a
25:30
culture of hard work and cooperation, training, etc. Societies that don't have
25:36
good human capital are either drawing down their resources or getting deeper into debt they won't be able to pay
25:42
back. That is, they're headed for trouble. While many countries have natural
25:48
resources that they are able to draw upon, human capital is the most sustainable capital because inherited
25:54
assets that are drawn down eventually disappear. Whereas human capital can
25:59
exist forever. Human capital is why people who come up with new ideas and build them
26:06
out, for example, entrepreneurs, beat giants with vast resources. Just look at Elon Musk and
26:13
his startup Tesla, which rivals resourcerich General Motors, Ford and
26:18
Chrysler, or Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, whose computer startups surpassed giants
26:24
like IBM and so on. Great human capital allows people to overcome their
26:30
weaknesses and identify and capitalize on their opportunities. It is the attribute that has allowed
26:37
small countries like the Netherlands, England, Switzerland and Singapore to achieve great wealth and in some cases
26:46
power. The most important human nature determinance across societies and
26:53
throughout time. People share the same human nature which makes them much more alike than different. People behave
27:00
similarly when faced with similar circumstances driving the big
27:06
cycles. Five, self-interest. Self-interest, especially
27:11
self-s survival, is the most powerful motivator for most people, organizations, and governments. However,
27:18
which self-interest, for example, the individuals, the families, the countries, etc. matters most is a
27:25
critical determinant of the society's success. Listen to the addendum that follows this
27:30
chapter to learn more. Six. The drive to gain and keep
27:36
wealth and power. The quest for wealth and power is a powerful motivator of
27:42
individuals, families, companies, states, and countries. Though that's not totally true because different
27:48
individuals, families, companies, states, and countries value wealth and power differently relative to other
27:55
things. For some, wealth and power are not nearly as important as other things that
28:00
life has to offer. But for most, especially those who become the most wealthy and powerful, the pursuit of
28:08
wealth and power is allconsuming. To be successful over the long run, a country must earn an amount
28:15
that is at least equal to what it spends. Those that earn and spend modestly and have a surplus are more
28:22
sustainably successful than those that earn and spend a lot more and have deficits. History shows that when an
28:29
individual, organization, country, or empire spends more than what it earns,
28:34
misery and turbulence are ahead. For more, listen to the
28:40
addendum. Seven. Capital markets. The ability to save and obtain buying
28:47
power through one's capital markets is essential to a country's well-being. For that reason, how well they are developed
28:54
is an important determinant of a country's success. Eight, the ability to learn
29:01
from history. Most people don't have this, which is an impediment, though it varies
29:07
by society. For example, the Chinese are excellent at this. Learning from one's
29:13
own experiences is not adequate because as explained earlier, many of the most important lessons don't come in one's
29:20
lifetime. In fact, many encounters in the future will be more opposite than similar to what one encountered before
29:27
in life. Since the peace boom period at the beginning of the cycle is opposite
29:32
to the war bust period at its end, the periods people face later in their lives
29:38
are more likely to be more opposite than similar to the ones they encountered earlier in their lives. More
29:44
specifically, in my opinion, if you don't understand what happened since at least 1900 and how that rhymes with what
29:51
is happening now, there is a high likelihood that you will find yourself in trouble.
29:58
Nine, the big multigenerational psychological cycle. Different generations think
30:05
differently because of their different experiences which leads them to make their decisions differently which
30:11
affects what happens to them and to subsequent generations. This is reflected in the
30:17
adage from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations.
30:23
Three generations is also roughly the length of time of a typical long-term debt cycle. However, history shows that
30:30
when these cycles are handled well, that is strong human capital is maintained over many generations, they can go on
30:38
for many generations. This multigenerational cycle takes place over several stages
30:43
that are described in the addendum to this chapter. 10. Favoring short-term
30:50
gratification over long-term well-being. This is another differentiator of people's and society's
30:58
successes. Those who favor long-term well-being over short-term well-being tend to do better. The human propensity
31:06
to choose short-term enjoyment over long-term well-being naturally exaggerates the highs and lows of the
31:12
cycle because it pulls the good times forward at the expense of the future.
31:17
That happens in many harmful ways, most classically by creating the debt boom and bust
31:23
cycle. Governments are especially vulnerable to this because of how the political dynamic works. More
31:30
specifically, A, politicians are motivated to prioritize the near-term
31:36
over the long term. B, they don't like to face limitations and difficult
31:41
financial trade-offs. for example, choosing whether to spend on the military for defense or to spend on
31:47
social programs. And C, it is politically threatening to take money
31:53
away from people by taxing them. This leads to a host of political and other
31:59
problems. 11. Humanity's inventiveness. Humanity's greatest power
32:06
is what drives human evolution, which is manifest in increased productivity and
32:11
higher living standards. Unlike other species, humans have a unique capacity to learn and
32:17
evolve their intellectual understanding. Plus, they invent things that materially
32:23
change their circumstances, producing advances in everything. These advances
32:28
produce the upward trending corkcrew I described in chapter 1. to imagine what
32:34
it would be like if humankind didn't have this ability. Look at other species. Without humanity's unique
32:40
ability to invent, our lives would be pretty much the same generation after generation because there would be far
32:48
fewer new things. There would be fewer surprises and advances. In fact, some
32:53
periods of human history were very much like that. However, it varies greatly
32:59
from one society to another. For more, listen to the addendum to this
33:05
chapter. Determinance shaped by culture. 12.
33:12
Culture. As the saying goes, culture is destiny. Cultural differences,
33:18
differences in how people believe they should be with each other matter enormously. All societies create
33:25
cultures based on how they think reality works. and they all provide principles for guiding how people should deal with
33:31
reality and most importantly how they should deal with each other. Culture drives the formal and
33:38
informal ways each society works. individuals known and unknown such as
33:43
Jesus, Confucious, Muhammad, Buddha, Mahavara, Guru Nanak, Plato, Socrates,
33:50
Marx, and many others have conveyed approaches to life that were captured in books such as the Hebrew Bible and the
33:57
New Testament, the Talmud, the Quran, the Iching, the Five Books and Four
34:02
Classics, the Analcts, the Upanisheds, the Bavad Gita, the Brahma Sutras,
34:08
Meditations, Republic, metaphysics, the wealth of nations and
34:13
dascapal. These together with the discoveries of scientists, artists, politicians, diplomats, investors,
34:20
psychologists, etc. All encountering their realities and adapting to them in their own ways are what determines a
34:28
people's culture. 13. Openness to global
34:34
thinking. This is a good leading indicator of strength because isolated
34:39
entities tend to miss out on the world's best practices which weakens them while learning about the best the world has to
34:47
offer helps people be their best. Isolation also prevents them from
34:52
benefiting from the challenge of facing off against the world's best competitors. History is littered with
34:59
cases in which countries were isolated, sometimes because they chose to cut themselves off to protect their
35:05
cultures. For example, the late Tang, late Ming, and early PRC periods in
35:10
China and the Edo period in Japan, and sometimes because of circumstances like
35:16
natural disasters and internal fighting. Both reasons lead them to fall behind in
35:22
their technology with terrible consequences. In fact, it is one of the most common reasons for empires and
35:28
dynasties failing. 14.
35:34
Leadership. Everything I've mentioned so far is influenced by the people in leadership
35:39
positions. Life is like a game of chess or the Chinese board game Go, in which
35:45
every move helps determine the outcome, and some players know how to make better moves than others. In the future, more
35:52
and more of those moves will be made with the aid of computers, but for now, they are still made by people. In
35:59
reading history, you see over and over how its course has been changed by the uniqueness, sometimes excellence,
36:06
sometimes terribleness, of a relatively few people in key areas such as the
36:11
government, the sciences, finance and commerce, the arts, and so on. In each
36:17
generation, roughly a few hundred people made all the difference. Studying what these key people in these
36:24
key roles were like, what they did in different situations, and the consequences of what they did helps us
36:31
understand how this perpetual motion machine
36:36
works. Determinance shaped by how individuals and groups interact with each
36:42
other. 15. Wealth gaps. Large and widening wealth gaps tend to
36:49
lead to periods of greater conflict, especially when economic conditions become bad and people are fighting over
36:55
a shrinking pie. 16. Values
37:01
gaps. While wealth matters, it is not the only thing that people fight over.
37:07
Values, for example, in religions and ideologies matter a lot, too. History
37:13
shows us that widening values gaps, especially during periods of economic stress, have tended to lead to periods
37:20
of greater conflict, while shrinking values gaps, tend to lead to periods of greater
37:25
harmony. This dynamic is driven by the fact that people tend to coalesce into
37:31
tribes that are bound together, often informally, by the magnetism of their members commonalities.
37:38
Naturally, such tribes operate with each other in ways that are consistent with their shared values. When under stress,
37:45
people with greater values gaps also prove to have greater conflict. They
37:50
frequently demonize members of other tribes rather than recognizing that those other tribes, like themselves, are
37:57
simply doing what is in their self-interest in the best ways they know how. 17. Class
38:05
struggles in all countries throughout time, though to varying degrees, people
38:11
are sorted into classes, either because they choose to be with people like themselves or because others assign them
38:17
to a class. Power is usually shared among three or four classes who in
38:23
aggregate make up only a small percentage of the population. The classes people are in typically
38:29
determine who their friends and allies are and who their enemies are. They are sorted into these classes
38:36
whether they like it or not because people stereotype. While rich and poor are the most common class distinctions,
38:43
there are many other important ones such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, lifestyle, location, for example, urban
38:50
versus rural, and politics, right versus left. Early in the big cycle, when times
38:57
are good, there's generally more harmony among the classes. And when things are bad toward the end, there is more
39:04
fighting. Class warfare has profound effects on the internal order, which I will explore in chapter 5. For more on
39:12
this determinant, listen to the addendum to this chapter 18. The political leftright
39:20
cycle. In all societies, there are swings between the political left and the political right that determine how
39:27
wealth and power are distributed. The swings are sometimes peaceful and
39:33
sometimes violent and are always important to understand. Typically the big cycle in the capital markets along
39:40
with cycles in wealth, values and class divisions drive the political left right
39:45
cycle because these create the motivations for political change. When capital markets and economies are
39:52
booming, wealth gaps typically increase. While some societies succeed at striking
39:58
a relatively sensible and steady balance between left and right, more frequently we see cyclical swings between norms.
40:06
These swings typically occur throughout empires rises and declines in roughly 10-year cycles. The big economic crises
40:14
that mark the end of the big cycle often herald revolutions. For more, listen to the
40:20
addendum to this chapter 19. The prisoner's dilemma must
40:26
be solved for peace to exist. The prisoner's dilemma is a
40:31
concept from game theory that explains why even when the best thing for two parties to do is to cooperate, the
40:38
logical thing for each to do is to kill the other first. That is because
40:44
survival is of paramount importance. And while you don't know for certain if your opponent will attack you, you do know
40:51
that it is in their interest to defeat you before you defeat them. It's for this reason that deadly
40:57
wars are best avoided by both sides establishing mutually assured protections against existential
41:04
harms. Exchanging benefits and creating interdependencies that would be intolerable to lose further reduces the
41:12
risk of conflict. 20. Whether there are win-win
41:18
relationships or lose-lose relationships, it is up to both parties
41:23
to choose what kind of relationship they have. That is true at all levels of relationships from individuals up to
41:30
countries. Most fundamentally, parties can choose whether to have a cooperative win-win relationship or a threatening
41:37
lose-lose relationship. That is to be allies or enemies. Though actions by
41:43
both determine what type of relationship they will have and whether it will work well. To be clear, win-win relationships
41:50
can exist between competitors as long as each side does not pose an existential risk to the other. Like the prisoners
41:57
dilemma. All that's required is that they know and respect each other's existential red lines. Parties in
42:04
win-win relationships can have tough negotiations, competing like two friendly merchants in a bizaar or two
42:11
teams at the Olympics. Having win-win relationships is obviously better than
42:16
having lose-lose relationships, but sometimes there are irreconcilable differences that must be fought over
42:22
because they can't be negotiated away. 21. The big balance of power cycle
42:30
that drives the big peace war cycle both within countries and between
42:36
countries. The balance of power dynamic is the timeless and universal dynamic of
42:41
allies and enemies working to gain wealth and power. It drives virtually
42:46
all struggles for power from office politics to local politics and from
42:51
national politics to geopolitics. In some cultures, this game is played a
42:57
bit differently than in other cultures. For example, in Western society, it is played more like chess, while in Asian
43:03
societies, it is played more like go. Though the objective is the same, to
43:08
dominate the other side, it has always existed and still exists everywhere and appears to
43:15
transpire along a consistent series of steps, which I describe in more detail when discussing the internal order in
43:22
chapter 5. Even though these same forces apply equally to internal and external
43:28
power struggles. For a more complete explanation of how the balance of power
43:33
cycle works, listen to the addendum to this chapter. 22. Military strength and the
43:41
peace war cycle. History shows us that military strength, whether one's own or anothers
43:48
via alliances, is a critical determinant of outcomes. Sometimes because the mere
43:53
threat of force is power and sometimes because the use of force is
43:59
required. Military strength is readily observable and measurable, but it can
44:04
also be qualitatively assessed. Internationally, military strength is especially important because there is no
44:11
effective international judicial and enforcement system. This leads to countries needing to fight to test their
44:17
relative powers and a cycle of war and peace that I will explain when discussing the external order cycle in
44:24
chapter 6. All these things come together to
44:29
determine internal orders, external orders, and how they
44:35
change. I have repeatedly seen all of these determine the levels and the rises and declines in wealth and power of all
44:41
peoples. I've seen them together create the circumstances the people of a country and/or its leaders face and how
44:48
they face them. They drive the internal and world orders and changes in
44:54
them. Like everything else, internal orders and world orders are constantly evolving and moving circumstances
45:01
forward through time as existing circumstances interact with each other and the forces that act on them to
45:07
produce new circumstances. Evolution occurs because of logical
45:13
cause effect relationships in which existing conditions and determinants propel changes that create a new set of
45:20
conditions and determinants that propel the next changes and so on like matter
45:25
and energy interacting in a perpetual motion machine because a given set of
45:30
circumstances creates a limited set of possibilities. By properly identifying
45:36
the circumstances and understanding the cause effect relationships, one can improve one's understanding of the
45:42
possibilities of what will come next and how to make wise decisions. For example, all countries
45:49
now have their existing way of choosing new leaders. In the US, the president is
45:54
chosen both by the voters in accordance with the democratic system laid out in the constitution and by how people
46:01
choose to operate within the system. How well this works depends on how effective
46:06
both are which is a result of prior determinants such as how effectively those in previous generations dealt with
46:13
and modified the system. The people now interacting with the system are different from those of previous
46:20
generations who were shaped by different circumstances. So we should expect different outcomes based on how people
46:26
today are different. Not having the historical perspective to
46:31
recognize those differences is a handicap. Once we see them and understand how the perpetual motion
46:38
machine works, we can see how different systems such as communism, fascism,
46:43
autocracies, democracies, and evolutionary descendants and hybrids of these such as state capitalism and China
46:51
evolve through time. Seeing this, we can imagine how new forms of internal orders to divide
46:57
wealth and allocate government political power may evolve and affect our lives based on how people choose to be with
47:04
each other and how human nature enters into their choices.
47:09
Now that I have described my mental model of how the world works rather superficially, in the rest of part one,
47:16
I will focus on the most important determinants, namely the three big cycles of debt and capital markets,
47:23
internal order, and external order in more detail. I will also describe what I
47:29
believe all this means for investing. Before you go on to that, you might want
47:34
to listen to the addendum to this chapter, which fleshes out some of the determinants that I only briefly covered
47:40
in this chapter. On the other hand, if you're feeling bogged down, you can skip it. That's why I made it an
47:48
addendum. Chapter 2, determinance addendum.
Chapter 2: Determinants Addendum
47:54
In chapter 2, I introduced some concepts that I thought might be worth explaining in greater depth, but didn't want to
48:00
include in the body of the chapter because these explorations could be too much. So, I decided to include them here
48:07
as an addendum in case you're interested in exploring them further. To help you make the connection, I refer to each
48:14
determinant or dynamic by title and number from chapter 2. Five.
48:22
Self-interest. While self-interest is the primary motivator for most people, organizations, and governments, the
48:28
question of which self is most important. Is it the individual, the family, the tribe, that is community,
48:34
the state, the country, the empire, humankind, all living things, the
48:40
universe. The following PDF diagram shows the possible units. The ones on
48:46
the top are more encompassing and the ones on the bottom are the less consolidated. What are most people in
48:53
your society and what are you willing to die for? The self that people are most
49:00
attached to is the one they will do the most to protect and this will drive their behaviors. For example, when people are
49:07
willing to die for their country, their country will be more likely to be protected than if the individual self is
49:13
more important. in which case individuals will run from deadly combat.
49:18
Within countries, one might see tribes be much more important than countries, which would lead to an entirely
49:24
different dynamic than if the opposite were true. That is why I find this dynamic worth keeping an eye on,
49:31
especially in conflicts. In looking at history across countries, I saw changes in the primary
49:38
unit that most people and societies optimized for. For example, before
49:43
around 1650, tribes and states were more important than countries. The peace of
49:49
West Failia in 1648 created countries, that is sovereign states as we now know
49:54
them. History shows that the groupings that people collect in and that are the
50:00
most important to them evolve. Gatherings of individuals and families make up a tribe, that is a community.
50:07
Gatherings of tribes or communities make up a state, for example, the state of Georgia. Gatherings of states make up a
50:14
country, for example, the United States. Gatherings of states or countries that are under unified control make up an
50:21
empire, for example, the British Empire. Sometimes smaller groupings coales into
50:27
bigger ones, changing boundaries in the process. For example, over the last 150
50:33
years in Europe, states coalesed into nations. many of which have coalesed into the European Union and sometimes
50:40
they break up into smaller units. For example, the Soviet Union broke up into its constituent countries and some
50:47
Middle Eastern countries have broken up into waring tribes. Over the last few years, the
50:53
world has been moving from being more globalist to being more nationalist. At the same time, the United States
51:00
appears to be losing its cohesion as people's views about how they should be with each other are becoming more
51:06
divergent. These divergencies are leading people to migrate to the states that align with their preferences,
51:12
causing those states to be more relevant individually than as parts of a unified whole. History and logic show us that
51:20
these changes in domestic and international orders are typically accompanied by conflicts because there
51:26
is a lot of disagreement about how they should work. For example, what states rights are relative to national rights.
51:33
Because most people haven't seen such changes before, they fail to recognize them for what they are. They are
51:40
important to stay on top of because they show the changing locus of control which typically signals a change in one's
51:47
rights and obligations. Think about it. What are you seeing happen? Are you seeing
51:53
coalescing or dissolving? From what level to what other level? What
51:58
implications do these changes have for you and where you want to be? Six, the drive to gain and keep
52:07
wealth and power. For the purposes of discussing the big cycles in later chapters, it's worth
52:13
defining wealth a bit more specifically and looking at its impact on countries that have it or lack it. I believe the
52:21
following to be by and large true. Wealth equals buying power.
52:27
Without getting too nuanced, let's call wealth buying power to distinguish it from money and credit. That distinction
52:34
is important because the value of money and credit changes. For example, when a lot of money and credit are created,
52:40
they go down in value. So, having more money won't necessarily give one more wealth or buying
52:47
power. Real wealth is not equal to financial wealth. Real wealth is what people buy
52:54
because they want to have and use it, such as a house, car, streaming, video service, etc. Real wealth has intrinsic
53:03
value. Financial wealth consists of financial assets that are held to a
53:08
receive an ongoing income in the future and or b be sold in the future to get
53:14
money to buy the real assets people will want. Financial wealth has no intrinsic
53:21
value. Making wealth equals being productive over the long run. The wealth
53:27
and buying power you have will be a function of how much you produce. That is because real wealth doesn't last long
53:34
and neither do inheritances. That is why being continuously productive is so
53:39
important. If you look at societies that expropriated the wealth of the rich and tried to live off it and weren't
53:46
productive, for example, Russia after the revolutions of 1917, you will see that it didn't take
53:52
them long to become poor. The less productive a society, the less wealthy
53:58
and hence the less powerful. By the way, spending money on investment and infrastructure rather than on
54:04
consumption tends to lead to greater productivity. So investment is a good leading indicator of
54:12
prosperity. Wealth equals power. That is because if one has enough
54:17
wealth, one can buy most anything. Physical property, the work and loyalty of others, education, health care,
54:24
influential powers of all sorts, political, military, etc., and so on.
54:30
Through time and across countries, history has shown that there is a symbiotic relationship between those who
54:35
have wealth and those who have political power and that the type of deal they have between them determines the ruling
54:42
order. That ruling order continues until the rulers are overthrown by others who
54:47
grab the wealth and power for themselves. Wealth and power are mutually supportive.
54:55
For example, in 1717, the British East India Company effectively brought
55:00
together financial capital, people with commercial capabilities, and people with military capabilities to force India's
55:07
Mughal Emperor to trade with them, which was the first step toward the British colonization of India, the fall of the
55:14
Mughal Empire in the 18th century, and then its complete failure in the 19th century when the British exiled the
55:21
emperor and executed his children after the 1857 7 Indian Rebellion. The British
55:27
did these things because they had the wealth and power to do them in pursuit of more wealth and
55:34
power. Wealth decline equals power decline. There isn't an individual,
55:40
organization, country, or empire that hasn't failed when it lost its buying
55:45
power. To be successful, one must earn an amount that is at least equal to the
55:50
amount one spends. Those who spend modestly and have a surplus are more
55:55
sustainably successful than those who earn a lot more and have deficits. History shows that when an
56:02
individual, organization, country, or empire spends more than what they earn, misery and turbulence are
56:09
ahead. History also shows that countries that have higher percentages of people who are self-sufficient tend to be more
56:16
socially, politically, and economically stable. Nine. the big multigenerational
56:23
psychological cycle. The rises and declines of countries correspond to these
56:29
psychological and economic cycles in the following ways and stages. Because these
56:35
stages are so useful in understanding the behavior of a country's people and leaders, I'm always trying to assess
56:41
what stages different countries are in. Stage one, people and their countries
56:48
are poor and they think of themselves as poor. In this stage, most people have
56:54
very low incomes and subsistence lifestyles. As a result, they don't waste money because they value it a lot
57:01
and they don't have much debt because nobody wants to lend to them. Some people have potential and some do not.
57:08
But in most cases, their poverty and lack of resources prevent them from gaining the education and other
57:14
capabilities that would allow them to pull themselves up. One's inherited circumstances and approach to life are
57:21
the biggest determinance of who emerges richer from this stage and who does not.
57:26
How fast countries evolve through this stage depends on their cultures and their abilities. I call countries in
57:33
this stage early stage emerging countries. Those that advance typically
57:39
work hard and gradually accumulate more money than they need to survive, which they save because they worry about not
57:45
having enough in the future. The evolution through this stage to the next typically takes about a generation.
57:52
Starting about 40 years ago until about 10 to 15 years ago, the Asian tigers of
57:58
Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea, and then China were examples of
58:03
economies in this stage. Stage two, people and their
58:09
countries are rich but still think of themselves as poor. Because people who grew up with
58:15
financial insecurity typically don't lose their financial cautiousness, people in this stage still work hard,
58:22
sell a lot to foreigners, have pegged exchange rates, save a lot, and invest
58:28
efficiently in real assets like real estate, gold, and local bank deposits and in bonds of the reserve currency
58:34
countries. Because they have a lot more money, they can and do invest in things that make
58:41
them more productive. For example, human capital development, infrastructure,
58:46
research and development, etc. This generation of parents wants to
58:51
educate their children well and get them to work hard to be successful. They also
58:57
improve their resource allocation systems, including their capital markets and their legal systems. This is the
59:03
most productive phase of the cycle. Countries in this stage experience rapidly rising income growth
59:11
and rapidly rising productivity growth at the same time. The productivity growth means two things. One, inflation
59:19
is not a problem. And two, the country can become more competitive. During this stage, debts
59:26
typically do not rise significantly relative to incomes and sometimes they decline. This is a very healthy period
59:34
and a terrific time to invest in a country if it has adequate property rights
59:39
protections. You can tell countries in this stage from those in the first stage because they have gleaming new cities
59:45
next to old ones, high savings rates, rapidly rising incomes, and typically
59:50
rising foreign exchange reserves. I call countries in this stage latestage emerging countries. While
59:58
countries of all sizes can go through this stage, when big countries go through it, they are typically emerging
1:00:04
into great world powers. Stage three, people in their
1:00:11
countries are rich and think of themselves as rich. At this stage, people's incomes
1:00:17
are high, so labor becomes more expensive. But their prior investments
1:00:22
in infrastructure, capital goods, and research and development are still paying off by producing productivity
1:00:28
gains that sustain their high living standards. Priorities shift from an
1:00:33
emphasis on working and saving in order to protect oneself from bad times to savoring the finer things in life.
1:00:41
People become more comfortable spending more. Arts and sciences typically flourish. This change in the prevailing
1:00:48
psychology is reinforced as a new generation of people who did not experience the bad times become an
1:00:55
increasingly large percentage of the population. Signs of this change in
1:01:00
mindset are reflected in statistics that show reduced work hours. For example, typically there is a reduction in the
1:01:07
work week from 6 days to 5 and big increases in expenditures on leisure and
1:01:13
luxury goods relative to necessities. At their best, these periods are early
1:01:18
and mid-stage renaissance periods. Large countries in this stage
1:01:24
almost always become world economic and military powers. Japan from 1971 to 1990
1:01:31
is an exception with regards to the military. Typically, they develop their
1:01:36
militaries in order to project and protect their global interests. Prior to
1:01:41
the midentth century, large countries at this stage literally controlled foreign governments and created empires from
1:01:48
them to provide the cheap labor and cheap natural resources they needed to remain competitive.
1:01:54
Starting in the early to mid 20th century when the US Empire began ruling by speaking softly and carrying a big
1:02:02
stick, American influence and international agreements have allowed developed countries to have access to
1:02:08
emerging countries cheap labor and investment opportunities without directly controlling their governments.
1:02:16
In this stage, countries are on top of the world and are enjoying it. I call
1:02:21
countries in this stage peak health countries. The United States was in this stage from 1950 to
1:02:28
1965. China is now moving into it. The key is to maintain the determinance
1:02:34
leading to strength for as long as possible. Stage four, people and their
1:02:40
countries are poorer and still think of themselves as rich. In this stage, debts rise relative
1:02:47
to income. The psychological shift behind this leveraging up occurs because the people
1:02:53
who lived through the first two stages have died off or become irrelevant. And those whose behavior matters most are
1:03:00
used to living well and not worrying about the pain of not having enough money. Because the workers in these
1:03:07
countries earn and spend a lot, they become expensive. And because they are expensive, they experience slower real
1:03:14
income growth rates. Since they are reluctant to constrain their spending in line with their reduced income growth
1:03:21
rates, they lower their savings rates, increase their debts, and cut corners.
1:03:27
Because their spending continues to be strong, they continue to appear rich even though their balance sheets are
1:03:34
deteriorating. The reduced level of efficient investments in infrastructure, capital, goods, and research and
1:03:40
development slows their productivity gains. Their cities and infrastructure become older and less efficient than in
1:03:47
the two previous stages. They increasingly rely on their reputation rather than on their competitiveness to
1:03:53
fund their deficits. Countries typically spend a lot of money on the military at
1:03:58
this stage to protect their global interests, sometimes in very large amounts because of wars. Often, though
1:04:06
not always, countries run twin deficits, that is both balance of payments and
1:04:12
government deficits. In the last few years of this stage, bubbles frequently
1:04:17
occur. Whether because of wars, Germany in World War I and the UK and World War
1:04:24
II are classic examples, or bursting financial bubbles or both. What typifies
1:04:29
this stage is an accumulation of debt that can't be paid back in nondepreciated money. I call countries
1:04:37
in this stage early declining countries. While countries of all sizes can go
1:04:42
through this stage, when big countries go through it, they are typically approaching their decline as great
1:04:49
empires. Stage five, people and their countries are poor and they think of
1:04:55
themselves as poor. This is when the gaps described in stage 4 cease to exist and the reality
1:05:02
of the country's situation is hitting home. After bubbles burst and
1:05:07
deleveragings occur, private debts grow while private sector spending, asset
1:05:12
values, and net worths decline in a self-reinforcing negative cycle. To
1:05:17
compensate, government debt and government deficits grow and central bank printing of money typically
1:05:23
increases. Central banks and governments cut real interest rates and increase nominal GDP
1:05:30
growth so that it is comfortably above nominal interest rates in order to ease debt burdens. As a result of these low
1:05:37
real interest rates, weak currencies and poor economic conditions, their debt and
1:05:42
equity assets perform poorly. Increasingly, these countries have to compete with less expensive
1:05:49
countries that are in earlier stages of development. Their currencies depreciate
1:05:54
and they like it because it makes the deleveraging less painful. As an extension of these economic and
1:06:00
financial trends, countries in this stage see their power in the world decline further. I call countries in
1:06:07
this stage clearly declined countries. It typically takes a long time, if it
1:06:12
ever happens, for clearly declined empires psychologies and attributes to go through the full cycle that brings
1:06:18
them to their old peaks again. The Romans and the Greeks never have, though
1:06:24
the Chinese have a few times. 11. Humanity's
1:06:31
inventiveness. Humanity's capacity to invent solutions to its problems and to
1:06:36
identify how to make things better has proven to be far more powerful than all of its problems combined.
1:06:43
Because knowledge is gained more than it is lost, it advances more in spurts and
1:06:49
sputters than in cycles that have downs as well as ups. The spurts come when
1:06:54
societies are in the upward swings of the big cycle, and the sputters come when they are in the downward swings.
1:07:01
The Renaissance periods of great creativity that produce advances in just about all areas, the sciences, the arts,
1:07:08
philosophies about how people should be with each other and govern, etc. come more during the peaceful and
1:07:15
prosperous parts of the big cycle when the systems for creating innovations are good rather than
1:07:21
bad. While specific inventions and the ways they come about have evolved through time, they have unwaveringly
1:07:28
evolved toward doing and making things better, replacing manual labor with
1:07:33
machines and automation and making people around the world more interconnected. There are always new
1:07:40
inventions and improvements. The most important and undeniable trend of technological advancement has been
1:07:46
toward higher living standards. That trend is likely to accelerate in unimaginable ways. Beyond that,
1:07:54
computerization is changing the character of decision-m, making it faster and less emotional. As helpful as
1:08:00
that is, it also poses certain dangers. The degree of inventiveness and
1:08:07
innovation in a society is the main driver of its productivity. An innovative and commercial spirit is
1:08:14
the lifeblood of a thriving economy. Without innovation, productivity growth would grind to a halt. Innovations that
1:08:21
allow a country's workers to produce more relative to the rest of the world feed into their cost competitiveness,
1:08:28
making them more attractive places to do business. The drive to tinker and
1:08:33
invent, to discover, to improve from prior failures. This is how people learn and find new and better ways of creating
1:08:41
things of value. In a market-based system, the most powerful way to drive innovation is to bring new ideas to
1:08:48
market and to commercialize and profit from them. The marketplace is incredibly
1:08:53
efficient at weeding out bad ideas and pricing good ones. In this way, the
1:08:59
concepts of innovation and commercialism go hand in hand. They capture whether people in a society value new knowledge
1:09:06
and the creation of new things and whether incentives are aligned to encourage them to seek a profit by
1:09:12
commercializing them. In other words, innovation plus commercial spirit plus
1:09:18
thriving capital markets equals great productivity gains equals increases in
1:09:23
wealth and power. Because there are big differences in the strengths of these determinants, I try
1:09:29
to measure them and take them into consideration in my model. 17. Class
1:09:37
struggles. For as long as there has been recorded history in almost all societies, a very small percentage of
1:09:43
the population, the ruling classes or the elites have controlled most of the
1:09:49
wealth and power. Though those percentages have varied. For example, in
1:09:54
the last century, the wealth share of the top 1% in the US ranged from close to 50% in the 1920s to a bit over 20% in
1:10:03
the late 1970s. In the UK, it ranged from over 70% in 1900 to around 15% in the 1980s
1:10:12
and is currently around 35%. Figures from World Inequality Database.
1:10:18
These shifts in inequality can be seen at least as far back as the Roman Republic as Walter Shidell describes in
1:10:26
the Great Leveler. Naturally, those who benefit from and control the system by and large
1:10:32
like the system and seek to maintain it. Because those with wealth can influence those with power and because those with
1:10:39
power can influence those with wealth. These ruling classes or elites have alliances among themselves and want to
1:10:46
maintain the existing order with everyone following its dictims and laws. Even as the system increases the gaps
1:10:52
between those with power and wealth and those without them. As a result, all
1:10:58
internal orders are run by certain classes of people who have wealth and power and who operate in symbiotic
1:11:04
relationships with each other to maintain the order. Though aligned not to disrupt the order that benefits them,
1:11:11
throughout time, these elites have struggled with each other over wealth and power and have also struggled with
1:11:17
non-elites who want wealth and power. When times are good and most people
1:11:22
prosper, the struggles are smaller. When times are bad, the struggles are worse. And when things are very bad for a large
1:11:30
percentage of the people, for example, there is an unresolvable debt crisis, a very bad economy, a very bad act of
1:11:37
nature. The resulting suffering, stress, and struggles typically lead to revolutions and/or civil wars.
1:11:46
As Aristotle said a long time ago, the poor and the rich quarrel with one
1:11:51
another, and whichever side gets the better, instead of establishing a just or popular government, regards political
1:11:58
supremacy as the prize of victory. Classically, the big cycle transpires
1:12:04
with periods of peace and productivity that increase wealth in a disproportionate way, which leads to a
1:12:11
very small percentage of the population gaining and controlling exceptionally large percentages of the wealth and
1:12:17
power. then becoming overextended, which leads to encountering bad times that
1:12:22
hurt those who are the least wealthy and powerful the hardest, which then leads to conflicts that produce revolutions
1:12:28
and/or civil wars, which then lead to the creation of a new order and the cycle beginning
1:12:35
again. Throughout time and in all countries, the people who have the wealth are the people who own the means
1:12:41
of wealth production. And in order to maintain it, they work with the people who have the power to set and enforce
1:12:48
the rules. While that has always been the case, the exact form of it has evolved and will continue to evolve.
1:12:56
For example, as explained in chapter 1, for most of the 13th through 19th centuries, the prominent internal order
1:13:03
all around the world consisted of the ruling classes or elites being one, the monarchy, which ruled in conjunction
1:13:10
with two, the nobility, which controlled the means of production. At the time, that capital was agricultural land, and
1:13:18
or three, the military. Workers were viewed as part of the means of production and had
1:13:24
essentially no say in how the order was run. Even societies that had little or
1:13:30
no contact with each other developed in similar ways because they had similar situations to deal with and because the
1:13:37
nature of their decision-making was similar. For example, for much of history, Europe, China, and most
1:13:44
countries had monarchs and nobles as the ruling classes. Yet, they were a bit different. In Europe, the church was
1:13:51
also part of the ruling mix. In Japan, the monarchy, the emperor and his ministers, the military and the business
1:13:58
community, the merchants and artisans were the ruling elites. Across countries, there always
1:14:04
were and still are different levels of governance at the country level, the state province level, the municipality
1:14:11
level, etc. And there are timeless and universal ways that they operate and interact with each other that have been
1:14:17
pretty consistent across the world. The monarchs needed people to manage the day-to-day operations for them. The top
1:14:24
people were ministers who oversaw the bureaucracies of people who did the various jobs that needed to be done for
1:14:30
government to work. What exists today is simply the result of the natural evolutions of these timeless and
1:14:37
universal ways of interacting with different countries own cultural flavors thrown in. For example, the roles of the
1:14:44
ministers who helped the monarchs evolved into the roles of prime ministers and other ministers that now
1:14:50
exist in almost all countries, though in the United States they are called
1:14:55
secretaries. Over time, these systems have evolved in varied but logical ways as a result of struggles for wealth and
1:15:02
power. For example, in England around 1200, there was a wealth and power struggle that evolved gradually at first
1:15:09
and then abruptly into a civil war, which is how these shifts tend to evolve
1:15:14
between the nobility and the monarchy. Like most of these struggles, the fight
1:15:19
was over money and the power to determine who got how much money. The
1:15:24
monarchy under King John wanted to get more tax money and the nobles wanted to give less tax money. They disagreed over
1:15:32
how much say the nobles should have on the matter. So they had a civil war. The
1:15:37
nobles won and gained more power to set the rules which led to what they first called a council which soon became the
1:15:44
first parliament which evolved into what exists in England today. The peace treaty that formalized this
1:15:51
deal into law in 1215 is called the Magna Carta. Like most laws, this one
1:15:57
didn't matter much relative to power. So, another civil war broke out in which the nobles and the monarchy again fought
1:16:04
over wealth and power. In 1225, they wrote up a new Magna Carta under Henry
1:16:09
III, King John's son, which those with power got to interpret and enforce. A
1:16:16
few decades later, the fighting picked up again. In that war, the nobles cut off tax payments to the monarchy, which
1:16:22
forced Henry III to give in to the nobles demands. These struggles went on
1:16:28
constantly, leading the orders to evolve. Fast forward to the 15th, 16th,
1:16:34
and 17th centuries, and one can see that there were big changes in the sources of wealth. at first because of global
1:16:41
exploration and colonialism starting with the Portuguese and the Spanish and later because of the invention of
1:16:47
capitalism, stocks and bonds and laborsaving machines that fueled the industrial revolutions particularly
1:16:54
helping the Dutch and then the British which made those who profited from these sources of wealth more powerful. That is
1:17:01
the shifts in wealth and power over these centuries were from Alandowning nobles who then had the
1:17:08
wealth and monarchies who then had the political power to b capitalists who in
1:17:13
the later period had the wealth and elected representatives or autocratic government leaders who in the later
1:17:20
period had the political power. Almost all countries made these shifts some
1:17:26
peacefully but most painfully. For example, in France, for
1:17:31
most of the 17th and 18th centuries, the king ruled in a balance of power arrangement with three other classes.
1:17:37
One, the clergy, two, the nobility, and three, the commoners. There were representatives of
1:17:44
these groups who voted. The first two classes, who accounted for only 2% of
1:17:49
the population, had more votes than, or eventually the same number of votes as
1:17:54
the commoners, who made up 98% of the population. They called this internal order based on
1:18:01
three classes these regime which means old order. Then practically overnight it
1:18:08
changed in a revolutionary way via the French Revolution which began on May 5th 1789 when the third class the commoners
1:18:16
had enough of that system overthrew the others and took the power for itself. In
1:18:22
most countries around the world at the time the same basic ruling order prevailed. That is the monarchy and
1:18:28
nobles who accounted for a very small percentage of the population and had most of the wealth ruled until all of a
1:18:35
sudden there was a civil war revolution that led the old order to be replaced with a very different new ruling
1:18:43
order. Though the internal orders for managing these class struggles were and are different in different countries,
1:18:49
they evolved similarly across countries. For example, they evolved both gradually
1:18:55
through reforms and abruptly through civil wars and revolutions. And they evolved into those orders that now exist
1:19:01
in all countries. I expect they will continue to evolve gradually and abruptly to produce new domestic orders.
1:19:09
While the classes who have the wealth and political power change, the processes that produce these changes
1:19:16
have remained pretty much the same through time right up to today. These changes have occurred through
1:19:22
struggles that have led to both a peaceful reforms through negotiations and b violent reforms via civil wars and
1:19:29
revolutions. The peaceful reforms tend to come earlier in the cycle and the violent civil wars and revolutionary
1:19:36
reforms tend to come later in the cycle for logical reasons that we will delve into
1:19:41
later. I cannot overstate the importance of class struggles relative to
1:19:47
individual struggles. We, especially those of us in the United States, which is thought of as a melting
1:19:53
pot, tend to focus more on individual struggles and not give adequate attention to class struggles. I didn't
1:20:01
fully realize the importance of class struggles until I did my extensive study of history, which led me to this
1:20:07
principle. In all countries throughout time, though in varying degrees, people find
1:20:14
themselves within classes, either because they choose to be with people like them or because others stereotype
1:20:21
them as part of certain groups. Power is usually shared among three or four classes. Who and what
1:20:28
people feel most connected with, are around the most, and are most like will determine which class or classes they
1:20:35
are in. How people are classed determines who their friends or allies are and who their enemies are. While
1:20:42
rich and poor and right that is capitalist and left that is socialist
1:20:47
are the most common big class distinctions. There are many other important distinctions such as race,
1:20:53
ethnicity, religion, gender, lifestyle for example liberal or conservative and
1:20:58
location for example urban versus suburban versus rural. Generally
1:21:04
speaking, people tend to cluster in these classes. And when times are good, early in the cycle, there is more
1:21:10
harmony among these classes. And when things are bad, there is more fighting among
1:21:15
them. While I love that the United States is the country where these class distinctions matter least, people's
1:21:22
classes still matter in the US, and they matter a lot more during stressful times when class conflicts intensify.
1:21:30
To help you get the picture in a more intimate way, let's do a simple exercise. Assume that most people who
1:21:38
don't know you well look at you as being a member of one or several classes because that's a good assumption. Now,
1:21:46
to imagine how you are perceived, look at the following list and ask yourself which classes you fall into. After you
1:21:53
answer that, ask yourself which classes you feel an affinity for and expect to be your allies. Which classes do you not
1:22:01
like or view as your enemies? Which ones are the ruling classes and which ones are the revolutionary classes who want
1:22:08
to topple them? Which ones are on the ascent and which ones are on the decline?
1:22:14
You might consider writing these down and thinking about them because during periods of greater conflict, the classes
1:22:20
you are in or are assumed to be in will become more important in determining who
1:22:25
you will be with and against, what you will do, and where you will end
1:22:31
up. One, rich or poor. Two, right, left
1:22:36
or moderate. Three, race. Four, ethnicity.
1:22:44
Five, religion. Six, gender. Seven, lifestyle, for example,
1:22:51
liberal or conservative. Eight, location, for example, urban, suburban, or
1:22:58
rural. Still today, only a small percentage of the population, which comes from only a few of these classes,
1:23:05
has most of the wealth and power and rules as the elites. To me, it is clear
1:23:11
that the capitalist class now has the most financial power in most countries and political power in democracies lies
1:23:18
in the hands of all the people who choose to vote. While in autocracies, it lies in the hands of the limited number
1:23:24
of people selected by whatever process they have to make selections. That doesn't mean that those who run
1:23:31
autocracies don't ultimately report to the people because the people could overthrow the government.
1:23:37
So for the most part today, those are the ruling classes and the elites who oversee the current domestic orders,
1:23:44
though they are now under attack. So this is probably shifting. For example,
1:23:49
there is now a big movement in the United States to be much more inclusive of members of different classes in both
1:23:55
the capitalist money-making world and in the political world. These shifts can be
1:24:00
good or bad depending on whether they are handled peacefully or violently and smartly or
1:24:06
stupidly. One timeless and universal truth that I saw go back as far as I
1:24:12
studied history since before Confucious who lived around 500 B.CE CE is that
1:24:18
those societies that draw on the widest range of people and give them responsibilities based on their merits
1:24:25
rather than privileges are the most sustainably successful because one they
1:24:30
find the best talent to do their jobs well two they have diversity of
1:24:35
perspectives and three they are perceived as the fairest which fosters
1:24:40
social stability. I presume that the current internal orders of countries like those
1:24:46
of the past will continue evolving to become something different through the struggles of different classes with each
1:24:52
other over how to divide wealth and political power. Because this wealth and
1:24:57
power dynamic is very important, it is worth watching closely to discern which classes are gaining and which ones are
1:25:04
losing wealth and power. For example, AI and information technology developers
1:25:09
are now evolving to gain it at the expense of those who are being replaced by such
1:25:15
technologies and also to discern the reactions to these shifts that lead the cycles to
1:25:21
change. So as I see it, everything is changing in classic ways driven by a
1:25:27
tried andrue perpetual motion machine. This machine has produced and is
1:25:32
producing different systems such as communism, fascism, autocracies, democracies, and evolutionary
1:25:38
descendants and hybrids of these such as state capitalism in China. It will
1:25:44
produce new forms of internal orders to divide wealth and allocate political power that will affect our lives greatly
1:25:50
all based on how people choose to be with each other and how human nature enters into how they make their choices.
1:26:00
18. The political left-right cycle. Capitalists, that is those of the
1:26:06
right, and socialists, that is those of the left, don't just have different self-interests. They have different
1:26:13
deep-seated ideological beliefs that they are willing to fight for. The typical perspective of the rightest
1:26:20
capitalist is that self-sufficiency, hard work, productivity, limited government interference, allowing people
1:26:26
to keep what they make, and individual choice are morally good and good for society. They also believe that the
1:26:34
private sector works better than the public sector, that capitalism works best for most people, and that self-made
1:26:40
billionaires are the biggest contributors to society. Capitalists are typically driven crazy
1:26:46
by financial supports for people who lack productivity and profitability. To
1:26:52
them, making money equals being productive equals getting what one deserves. They don't pay much attention
1:26:58
to whether the economic machine is producing opportunity and prosperity for most people. They can also overlook the
1:27:05
fact that their form of profitm is suboptimal when it comes to achieving the goals of most people. For example,
1:27:12
in a purely capitalist system, the provision of excellent public education, which is clearly a leading cause of
1:27:19
higher productivity and greater wealth across a society, is not a high
1:27:25
priority. The typical perspective of the leftist socialist is that helping each
1:27:30
other, having the government support people, and sharing wealth and opportunity are morally good and good
1:27:36
for society. They believe that the private sector is by and large run by capitalists who are greedy while common
1:27:43
workers such as teachers, firefighters, and laborers contribute more to society. Socialists and communists tend
1:27:50
to focus on dividing the pie well and typically aren't very good at increasing its size. They favor more government
1:27:58
intervention, believing those in government will be fairer than capitalists, who are simply trying to
1:28:04
exploit people to make more money. I've had exposure to all kinds of
1:28:09
economic systems all over the world and have seen why the ability to make money,
1:28:15
save it, and put it into capital, that is capitalism, is an effective motivator
1:28:20
of people and allocator of resources that raises people's living standards.
1:28:25
But capitalism is also a source of wealth and opportunity gaps that are unfair, can be counterproductive, are
1:28:32
highly cyclical, and can be destabilizing. In my opinion, the greatest challenge
1:28:38
for policymakers is to engineer a capitalist economic system that raises
1:28:43
productivity and living standards without worsening inequities and
1:28:49
instabilities. 21. The big balance of power cycle that drives the big peace
1:28:55
war cycle both within countries and between countries. In studying a lot of history and
1:29:01
experiencing a tiny sliver of it myself, I have seen how the balance of power dynamic drives virtually all struggles
1:29:08
for power. For example, office politics within organizations, local and national
1:29:13
politics in shaping the domestic order and international politics in shaping the world order. It applies equally well
1:29:20
to determining the formations and changes in world orders as in domestic orders. The dynamic transpires in a
1:29:28
series of steps explained here. Though how exactly it unfolds depends on the order and people at the time these
1:29:35
stages unfold. Step one, the formation of
1:29:41
alliances. When there isn't roughly equal power, for example, if in the US the Democrats have much more power than
1:29:48
the Republicans or vice versa, the more powerful party will take advantage of and control the less powerful party.
1:29:56
To neutralize the stronger party, the weaker party naturally finds other parties to join it in opposing the
1:30:02
stronger party. So, collectively they can have the same or more power as the opposition. The weaker party does this
1:30:09
by giving the other parties what they want in return for their support. If the formerly weaker party
1:30:16
collectively gains more power than the formerly stronger party from doing this, the formerly stronger party cuts deals
1:30:22
with other parties to ally with them to eliminate the superiority of the
1:30:27
opposition. As a result, allies who have very different vested interests unite in
1:30:33
opposing the common enemy. As the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This dynamic naturally leads to
1:30:40
the different sides having roughly equal amounts of power and splits within themselves. Sometimes the differences
1:30:48
within the parties are so great that some segments want to destroy the other segments in order to gain control of
1:30:54
their party. This alliance and enemy forming dynamic happens at all different
1:30:59
levels of relationships. From the most important international alliances that define the most important elements of
1:31:06
the world order down to the most important alliances within countries that define the internal orders down to
1:31:12
those within states, within cities, within organizations and among individuals.
1:31:18
The most important evolutionary shift to affect these has been the shrinking of the world to make allies and enemies
1:31:25
more global. In the old days, they were less global. For example, European
1:31:30
countries formed alliances to fight other European countries. Asian countries did the same in Asia, etc. But
1:31:37
as the world has shrunk because of improved transportation and communications, it has become more
1:31:43
interconnected and bigger and more global alliances have developed. That is why there were two big sides in World
1:31:50
Wars one and two and likely will be going forward. Step two, war to determine the
1:31:57
winners and losers. Big fights typically happen when both sides have roughly equal powers and
1:32:04
existential differences exist between them. Big fights typically don't occur when there are big asymmetries in power
1:32:11
because it would be stupid for obviously weaker entities to fight obviously stronger ones. And if they did fight,
1:32:17
the fights would be small in scale. However, sometimes when there are roughly equal levels of power on both
1:32:25
sides, stalemates and gridlocks rather than big fights can occur when the existential threat of harming oneself in
1:32:31
the process of trying to beat the other side is greater than the gains that would come from having a fight to the
1:32:37
death. For example, when there is mutually assured destruction, for example, as the US and the Soviet Union
1:32:44
faced, there is more likely to be a standoff than a fight. While these big fights are
1:32:51
typically violent, they can be nonviolent if the entities have nonviolent rules of engagement that they
1:32:57
adhere to that allow the resolution of disputes, most importantly, the existential ones. For example, in the
1:33:04
2020 US election, the two political parties had roughly equal amounts of power and irreconcilable differences so
1:33:11
that they had a big fight for political control. That led to the storming of the
1:33:16
US capital on January 6th, 2021. But eventually, the peaceful transfer of
1:33:21
political power as set out in the Constitution prevailed. History has shown that when there are
1:33:27
not clear rules and or when the parties don't abide by them, the fighting will be far more brutal, often to the
1:33:36
death. Step three, fighting among the winners. History shows us that after the fight
1:33:43
for power in which the common enemy is defeated, those who united against the common enemy typically fight among
1:33:49
themselves for power and those in the losing party do the same as they plan their next attack. I call this the purge
1:33:57
state of the balance of power dynamic. It has happened in all cases with the
1:34:02
reign of terror in France and the red terror in the Soviet Union being the most wellknown.
1:34:08
This same sort of fighting has happened between countries as with the US and the Soviet Union who were allies in World
1:34:15
War II. Similarly, the United Front of Chinese Communists and Nationalists that
1:34:20
fought the Japanese in the war immediately battled each other for power when the war was over. Understanding
1:34:27
this typical dynamic, one should look out for internal fighting among the winners right after the big war is over.
1:34:34
We should always watch whether the factions within the same parties are inclined to fight each other for control
1:34:40
of their parties. When new regimes, that is the winning parties, come to power, watch
1:34:47
what they do with the enemies they defeated. What happens next depends on the system and the leaders in the
1:34:53
system. In the US and generally in democracies, the rules allow the losers to remain unharmed and unconstrained,
1:35:00
which allows them to try to regain power and fight again. In harsh autocracies,
1:35:06
the losers are eliminated one way or another. Step four, peace and prosperity
1:35:13
occur but eventually lead to excesses reflected in large wealth and opportunity gaps and overindness.
1:35:21
History shows us that because of this dynamic, the best of times, that is when there is peace and prosperity, typically
1:35:28
happens after a war when the leadership and power structure are clearly established. So there isn't big fighting
1:35:35
for power within the country or with other countries because there is an obviously more powerful entity that
1:35:41
enables the less powerful entities to have a good life.
1:35:46
Step five, increasing conflict leads to revolutionary changes in domestic and
1:35:52
world orders. For as long as there is peace and prosperity for the majority of the
1:35:58
people, which will only be the case if the system is fair and the majority of the people remain selfdisciplined and
1:36:04
productive, peace and prosperity are likely to continue. However, as
1:36:10
previously discussed, periods of peace and prosperity also tend to encourage big wealth gaps and debt bubbles that
1:36:16
lead to conflicts when prosperity fades. And there are other things to fight
1:36:22
over. This cycle tracks the internal and external order and disorder cycles that
1:36:28
we will explore in chapters 5 and six. Chapter 3. The big cycle of money,
Chapter 3: The Big Cycle of Money, Credit, Debt, and Economic Activity
1:36:36
credit, debt, and economic activity. What most people and their
1:36:42
countries want most is wealth and power. And money and credit are the biggest influences on how wealth and power rise
1:36:49
and decline. If you don't understand how money and credit work, you can't understand how the system works. And if
1:36:56
you don't understand how the system works, you can't understand what's coming at you. For example, if you don't understand how
1:37:03
the roaring 20s led to a debt bubble and a big wealth gap, how the bursting of that debt bubble led to the 1930
1:37:10
through33 Great Depression, and how the depression led to conflicts over wealth all over the world, you won't understand
1:37:17
why Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president in 1932. You also won't understand why soon after
1:37:23
his inauguration, he announced a new plan in which the central government and the federal reserve would together
1:37:29
provide a lot of money and credit. A change that was similar to what was happening in other countries at the time
1:37:35
and that is similar to what is happening today in response to the pandemic caused crisis. Unless you understand how money
1:37:42
and credit work, you can't understand why the world changed as it did in 1933
1:37:48
or what happened next, World War II. how the war was won and lost and why the new
1:37:53
world order was created as it was in 1945. But when you recognize the
1:37:59
underlying mechanics that drove all of those things in the past, you can also understand what is happening now and
1:38:05
have a much better sense about what is likely to happen in the future. In speaking with several of the
1:38:11
world's most renowned historians and political practitioners, including current and former heads of state,
1:38:17
foreign ministers, finance ministers, and central bankers, we recognized that we each held different pieces of the
1:38:24
puzzle to explain how the world works. I had been lacking an adequate practical understanding of the workings of
1:38:30
politics and geopolitics, and they lacked an adequate practical understanding of the way that money and
1:38:36
credit work. Several told me that understanding money and credit in this way has been the biggest missing piece
1:38:42
in their quest to understand the lessons of history. And I explained to them that their perspectives helped me understand
1:38:48
the political dynamics that affect policy choices. This chapter is focused on the money, credit, and economic
1:38:56
piece. Let's start with money and credit. The timeless and universal
1:39:02
fundamentals of money and credit. All entities, people, companies,
1:39:08
nonprofit organizations, and governments deal with the same basic financial realities and always have. They have
1:39:15
money that comes in, that is revenue, and money that goes out, that is expenses, that when netted, make up
1:39:21
their net income. These flows are measured in numbers that appear in income
1:39:26
statements. If an entity brings in more than it spends, it has a profit that causes its savings to go up. If it
1:39:33
spends more than it earns, its savings go down or it makes up the difference by borrowing or taking money from someone
1:39:40
else. If an entity has many more assets than liabilities, that is a large net
1:39:45
worth, it can spend above its income by selling assets until the money runs out,
1:39:50
at which point it has to slash its expenses. If it doesn't have much more
1:39:55
in assets than it has in liabilities and its income falls beneath the amount it needs to pay out to cover the total of
1:40:02
its operating expenses and its debt service expenses, it will have to cut its expenses or will default or
1:40:09
restructure its debts. All of an entity's assets and liabilities, that is debts, can be shown
1:40:16
in its balance sheet. Whether it writes those numbers down or not, every country, company, nonprofit
1:40:22
organization, and individual has them. When economists, for example, combine
1:40:27
each entity's income, expenses, and savings, they get all entities incomes, expenses, and savings. The way entities
1:40:35
collectively handle their finances as reflected in their income statements and balance sheets is the biggest driver of
1:40:42
changes in internal and world orders. If you can take your understanding of your own income, expenses, and savings,
1:40:49
imagine how that applies to others and put them together, you will see how the
1:40:54
whole thing works. Take a moment to think about your own financial situation. How much income
1:41:01
do you have now relative to your expenses and how much will you have in the future? How much savings do you have
1:41:08
and what are those savings invested in? Now, play things out. If your income
1:41:14
fell or disappeared, how long would your savings last? How much risk do you have
1:41:19
in the value of your investments and savings? If that value fell by half, how
1:41:24
would you be financially? Can you easily sell your assets to get cash to pay your
1:41:30
expenses or service your debts? What are your other sources of money from the government or from elsewhere? These are
1:41:37
the most important calculations you can make to ensure your economic well-being. Now look at others, other people,
1:41:44
businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments, realizing that the same is true for them. See how we are
1:41:51
interconnected and what changes and conditions might mean for you and others who might affect you. Since the economy
1:41:58
is the sum of these entities operating in this way, it will help you understand what is happening and what is likely to
1:42:05
happen. For example, since one entity's spending is another's income, when one entity
1:42:11
cuts its expenses, that will hurt not just that entity, but it will also hurt
1:42:16
others who depend on that spending to earn income. Similarly, since one
1:42:22
entity's debts are another's assets, an entity that defaults reduces other entities assets, which requires them to
1:42:29
cut their spending. This dynamic produces a self-reinforcing downward debt and economic contraction that
1:42:36
becomes a political issue as people argue over how to divide the shrunken
1:42:41
pie. As a principle, debt eats equity. What I mean by that is that debts have
1:42:48
to be paid above all else. For example, if you own a house, that is you have
1:42:54
equity ownership and you can't make the mortgage payments, the house will be sold or taken away. In other words, the
1:43:01
creditor will get paid ahead of the owner of the house. As a result, when
1:43:06
your income is less than your expenses and your assets are less than your liabilities, that is debts, you are on
1:43:13
the way to having to sell your assets. Unlike what most people
1:43:18
intuitively think, there isn't a fixed amount of money and credit in existence.
1:43:24
Money and credit can easily be created by central banks. People, companies,
1:43:29
nonprofit organizations, and governments like it when central banks make a lot of money in credit because it gives them
1:43:36
more spending power. When the money and credit are spent, it makes most goods, services, and investment assets go up in
1:43:42
price. It also creates debt that has to be repaid which requires people, companies, nonprofit organizations and
1:43:49
governments to eventually spend less than they earn which is difficult and
1:43:55
painful. That is why money, credit, debt and economic activity are inherently
1:44:01
cyclical. In the credit creation phase, demand for goods, services, and investment assets and the production of
1:44:08
them are both strong. And in the debt repayment phase, both are weak.
1:44:13
But what if the debts never had to be paid back? Then there would be no debt squeeze and no painful paying back
1:44:20
period. But that would be terrible for those who lent because they'd lose their money, right? Let's think for a moment
1:44:28
to see if we can find a way of resolving debt issues without harming either borrowers or
1:44:34
lenders. Since governments have the ability to both make and borrow money,
1:44:39
why couldn't the central bank lend money at an interest rate of about 0% to the central government to distribute as it
1:44:46
likes to support the economy? Couldn't it also lend to others at low rates and
1:44:51
allow those debtors to never pay it back? Normally, debtors have to pay back the original amount borrowed, principal,
1:44:58
plus interest in installments over a period of time. But the central bank has the power to set the interest rate at 0%
1:45:06
and keep rolling over the debt so that the debtor never has to pay it back.
1:45:11
That would be the equivalent of giving the debtors the money. But it wouldn't look that way because the debt would
1:45:16
still be accounted for as an asset that the central bank owns. So the central bank could still say it is performing
1:45:23
its normal lending functions. This is the exact thing that happened in the wake of the economic crisis caused
1:45:30
by the CO 19 pandemic. Many versions of this have happened many times in history. Who
1:45:37
pays? It is bad for those outside the central bank who still hold the debts as
1:45:43
assets, cash and bonds, who won't get returns that would preserve their purchasing power.
1:45:50
The biggest problem that we now collectively face is that for many people, companies, nonprofit
1:45:55
organizations, and governments, their incomes are low in relation to their expenses, and their debts and other
1:46:02
liabilities such as those for pensions, health care, and insurance are very large relative to the value of their
1:46:09
assets. It may not seem that way. In fact, it often seems the opposite because there are many people,
1:46:15
companies, nonprofit organizations, and governments that look rich even while they are in the process of going broke.
1:46:22
They look rich because they spend a lot, have plenty of assets, and even have plenty of cash. However, if you look
1:46:29
carefully, you will be able to identify those that look rich but are in financial trouble because they have
1:46:35
incomes that are below their expenses and or liabilities that are greater than their assets. So, if you project what
1:46:41
will likely happen to their finances in the future, you will see that they will have to cut their expenses and sell
1:46:48
their assets in painful ways that will leave them broke. We each need to do
1:46:53
those projections of what the future will look like for our own finances, for others who are relevant to us and for
1:46:59
the world economy. In a nutshell, for some people, companies, nonprofit organizations, and countries, the
1:47:06
liabilities are enormous relative to the net incomes and the asset values that are required to meet those obligations.
1:47:13
So, they are financially weak, but they don't look that way because they spend a lot financed by
1:47:20
borrowing. If anything I've written here is confusing to you, I urge you to take
1:47:25
a moment to try to apply it to your own circumstances. Pencil out what your financial safety margin looks like. How
1:47:32
long will you be financially okay if the worst case scenario happens? For example, you lose your job and your
1:47:39
investment assets fall to be only half as much to account for possible price falls, taxes, and
1:47:45
inflation. Then do that calculation for others. Add them up and then you will
1:47:50
have a good picture of the state of your world. I've done that with the help of my partners at Bridgewater and find it
1:47:57
invaluable in imagining what is likely to happen. You can find more of my perspective on this and several papers
1:48:04
at economicprinciples.org. In summary, these basic financial realities work for
1:48:11
all people, companies, nonprofit organizations, and governments in the same way they work for you and me, with
1:48:18
the one big important exception I mentioned earlier. All countries can create money and credit out of the air
1:48:25
to give to people to spend or lend out. By producing money and giving it to
1:48:31
debtors in need, central banks can prevent the debt crisis dynamic that I just explained. For that reason, I will
1:48:38
modify the prior principle to say debt eats equity, but central banks can feed
1:48:44
debt by printing money instead. It should be no surprise that governments print money when debt crises
1:48:51
cause politically unacceptable amounts of equity eating debt and corresponding economic
1:48:58
pain. However, not all money that governments print is of equal value. The
1:49:04
monies that is currencies that are widely accepted around the world are called reserve currencies.
1:49:10
At the time of my writing this, the world's dominant reserve currency is the US dollar, which is created by the US
1:49:17
Central Bank, the Federal Reserve. A much less important reserve currency is
1:49:22
the euro, which is produced by the Eurozone country's central bank, the European Central Bank. The Japanese yen,
1:49:30
the Chinese Renman B, and the British pound are relatively small reserve currencies now, though the Renman B is
1:49:37
quickly growing in importance. Having a reserve currency is great while
1:49:42
it lasts because it gives a country exceptional borrowing and spending power and significant power over who else in
1:49:49
the world gets the money and credit needed to buy and sell internationally. However, having a
1:49:55
reserve currency typically sews the seeds of a country ceasing to be a reserve currency country. That is
1:50:02
because it allows the country to borrow more than it could otherwise afford to borrow. And the creation of lots of
1:50:08
money and credit to service the debt debases the value of the currency and causes the loss of its status as a
1:50:14
reserve currency. The loss of its reserve currency status is a terrible
1:50:20
thing because having a reserve currency is one of the greatest powers a country can have because it gives the country
1:50:26
enormous buying power and geopolitical power. In contrast, non-reserve currency
1:50:33
countries often find themselves in need of money in a reserve currency, for example, dollars, when they have a lot
1:50:40
of debt denominated in that currency, which they can't print, or they don't have much savings in that currency, and
1:50:46
their ability to earn the currency they need falls off. When countries desperately need reserve currencies to
1:50:53
service their reserve currency denominated debts and to buy things from sellers who only accept reserve
1:50:59
currencies, they can go bankrupt. This has happened often in the past and it is
1:51:05
where things now stand for a number of countries. It is also where things stand for local governments and states and for
1:51:12
many of us. This configuration of circumstances has been handled in the same way. So it's easy to see how this
1:51:19
machine works and that is what I will show you in this chapter. Let's start with the basics and
1:51:25
build from there. What is money? Money is a medium of exchange
1:51:33
that can also be used as a storehold of wealth. By medium of exchange, I mean
1:51:39
something that can be given to others to buy things. Basically, people produce things in order to exchange them with
1:51:45
people who have other things they want. Because carrying around non-money objects in the hope of exchanging them
1:51:51
for what one wants, that is, bartering, is inefficient, virtually every society
1:51:57
that has ever existed has created a form of money, that is currency, which is something portable that everyone agrees
1:52:04
is of value, so it can be exchanged for what they want. By a storehold of wealth, I mean a
1:52:11
vehicle for storing buying power between acquiring it and spending it. While one of the most logical things to store
1:52:17
wealth in is a claim on money that can be used later, people also store their wealth in assets that they expect will
1:52:24
retain their value or appreciate, such as gold, silver, gems, paintings, real
1:52:29
estate, stocks, and bonds. By holding on to something that appreciates, they
1:52:35
figure they can do a bit better than just holding on to the currency and when needed can always exchange the thing
1:52:41
they're holding to get the currency to buy the things they want to buy. This is where credit and debt come into the
1:52:47
picture. It is important to understand the difference between money and debt. Money is what settles claims. You pay
1:52:54
your bills and are done. Debt is a promise to deliver money.
1:53:00
When lenders lend, for example, they assume the money plus the interest they receive back will buy more goods and
1:53:06
services than if they had simply held on to the money. When all goes well, the borrowers use the money productively and
1:53:13
earn a profit with it themselves. So, they can pay the lenders back and still have money left over. While the loan is
1:53:20
outstanding, it is an asset for the lender, for example, a bond, and a liability, that is debt, for the
1:53:27
borrower. When the money is paid back, the assets and liabilities disappear and
1:53:32
both the borrower and lender are better off having essentially split the profits that came from the productive lending.
1:53:39
Such lending is also good for society which benefits from the resulting productivity gains. While borrowers are
1:53:46
typically willing to pay interest, which is what gives lenders the incentive to lend, nowadays there are some debt
1:53:52
assets that have negative interest rates, which is a weird story that we will explore later.
1:53:58
It's important to realize that most money and credit, especially the governmentissued money that now exists,
1:54:04
have no intrinsic value. They are just journal entries in an accounting system that can easily be changed. The purpose
1:54:12
of that system is to help allocate resources efficiently so that productivity can grow, rewarding both
1:54:18
lenders and borrowers. But the system periodically breaks down. When that
1:54:24
happens, as it always has since the beginning of time, the currency supply is monetized. Monetized means the
1:54:30
central bank's creation of money to buy debt, and currency values fall or are
1:54:36
destroyed, and wealth shifts in a big way, sending shock waves through the economy and
1:54:42
markets. What all this means is that the debt and credit machine doesn't work perfectly. Supplies, demands, and values
1:54:49
of money cycle up and down. The upswings produce joyful abundance. The down
1:54:54
swings produce painful restructurings. Let's now get into how these cycles work. Building from the
1:55:01
fundamentals up to where we are now. Money, credit, and
1:55:08
wealth. While money and credit are associated with wealth, they aren't the same thing as wealth. Because money and
1:55:15
credit can buy wealth, that is goods and services. The amount of money and credit you have and the amount of wealth you
1:55:21
have look pretty much the same. But you cannot create more wealth simply by creating more money and credit. To
1:55:29
create more wealth, you have to be more productive. The relationship between the creation of money and credit and the
1:55:35
creation of wealth is often confused. Yet, it is the biggest driver of economic cycles. Let's look at it more
1:55:42
closely. There is typically a mutually reinforcing relationship between the
1:55:47
creation of money and credit and the creation of goods, services, and investment assets that are produced,
1:55:53
which is why they're often confused as being the same thing. Think of it this way. There is both a financial economy
1:56:00
and a real economy. Though they are related, they are different. Each has its own supply and demand factors that
1:56:07
drive it. In the real economy, supply and demand are driven by the amount of
1:56:12
goods and services produced and the number of buyers who want them. When the level of goods and services demanded is
1:56:19
strong and rising and there is not enough capacity to produce the things demanded, the real economy's capacity to
1:56:26
grow is limited. If demand keeps rising faster than the capacity to produce,
1:56:32
prices go up and inflation rises. That's where the financial economy comes in.
1:56:38
Facing inflation, central banks normally tighten money and credit to slow demand in the real economy. When there is too
1:56:45
little demand, they do the opposite by providing money and credit to stimulate demand. By raising and lowering supplies
1:56:53
of money and credit, central banks are able to raise and lower the demand and production of financial assets, goods,
1:56:59
and services. But they're unable to do this perfectly. So we have the
1:57:04
short-term debt cycle which we experience as alternating periods of growth and
1:57:09
recession. Then of course there is the value of money and credit to consider which is based on its own supply and
1:57:16
demand. When a lot of currency is created relative to the demand for it, it declines in value. Where the money
1:57:23
and credit flow is important to determining what happens. For example, when they no longer go into lending that
1:57:30
fuels increases in economic demand and instead go into other currencies and
1:57:35
inflation hedge assets, they fail to stimulate economic activity and instead
1:57:40
cause the value of the currency to decline and the value of inflation hedge assets to rise. At such times, high
1:57:48
inflation can occur because the supply of money and credit has increased relative to the demand for it, which we
1:57:55
call monetary inflation. That can happen at the same time as there is weak demand for goods and
1:58:01
services and the selling of assets so that the real economy is experiencing
1:58:06
deflation. That is how inflationary depressions come about. For these reasons, we have to watch movements in
1:58:13
the supplies and demands of both the real economy and the financial economy to understand what is likely to happen
1:58:19
financially and economically. For example, how financial
1:58:25
assets are produced by the government through fiscal and monetary policy has a huge effect on who gets the buying power
1:58:32
that goes along with them, which also determines what the buying power is spent on. Normally, money and credit are
1:58:39
created by central banks and flow into financial assets, which the private credit system uses to finance people's
1:58:46
borrowing and spending. But in moments of crisis, governments can choose where to direct money, credit, and buying
1:58:53
power rather than it being allocated by the marketplace, and capitalism as we know it is suspended. This is what
1:59:00
happened worldwide in response to the CO 19 pandemic. Related to this confusion
1:59:07
between the financial economy and the real economy is the relationship between the prices of things and the value of
1:59:13
things. Because they tend to go together, they can be confused as being the same thing. They tend to go together
1:59:19
because when people have more money and credit, they are more inclined to spend more and can spend more. To the extent
1:59:26
that spending increases economic production and raises the prices of goods, services, and financial assets,
1:59:33
it can be said to increase wealth because the people who already own those assets become richer when measured by
1:59:40
the way we account for wealth. However, that increase in wealth is more an
1:59:45
illusion than a reality for two reasons. One, the increased credit that pushes
1:59:50
prices and production up has to be paid back, which all things being equal, will
1:59:55
have the opposite effect when the bill comes due. And two, the intrinsic value of a thing doesn't increase just because
2:00:02
its price goes up. Think about it this way. If you own a house and the government creates a lot of money in
2:00:09
credit, there might be many eager buyers who would push the price of your house up, but it's still the same house. Your
2:00:16
actual wealth hasn't increased, just your calculated wealth. It's the same with any other investment asset you own
2:00:23
that goes up in price when the government creates money, stocks, bonds, etc. the amount of calculated wealth
2:00:30
goes up, but the amount of actual wealth hasn't gone up because you own the exact same thing you did before it was
2:00:36
considered to be worth more. In other words, using the market values of what one owns to measure one's wealth gives
2:00:44
an illusion of changes in wealth that don't really exist. As far as
2:00:49
understanding how the economic machine works, the important thing to understand is that money and credit are stimulative
2:00:56
when they're given out and depressing when they have to be paid back. That's what normally makes money, credit, and
2:01:03
economic growth so cyclical. The central bankers who control money and credit, that is
2:01:09
central banks, vary the costs and availability of money and credit to control markets and the economy. When
2:01:17
the economy is growing too quickly and they want to slow it down, central bankers make less money and credit
2:01:22
available, causing both to become more expensive. This encourages people to lend rather than borrow and spend. When
2:01:30
there's too little growth and central bankers want to stimulate the economy, they make money and credit cheap and
2:01:36
plentiful, which encourages people to borrow and invest and or spend. These
2:01:42
variations in the cost and availability of money and credit also cause the prices and quantities of goods,
2:01:48
services, and investment assets to rise and fall. But banks can only control the
2:01:53
economy within their capacities to produce money and credit growth, and their capacities to do that are
2:02:00
limited. Think of the central bank as having a bottle of stimulant it can inject into the economy as needed. When
2:02:07
the markets and the economy sag, it delivers shots of the money and credit stimulant to pick them up. When the
2:02:13
markets and economy are too strong, it gives them less or no stimulant. These moves lead to cyclical rises and
2:02:20
declines in the amounts and prices of money and credit and of goods, services, and financial assets. These moves
2:02:28
typically come in the form of short-term debt cycles and long-term debt cycles.
2:02:33
The short-term debt cycles of ups and downs typically last about 8 years, give or take a few. The timing is determined
2:02:40
by how long it takes the stimulant to raise demand to the point that it reaches the limits of the real economy's
2:02:46
capacity to produce. Most people have seen enough of these short-term debt cycles, popularly known as the business
2:02:54
cycle, to know what they are like to such an extent that they mistakenly think they will go on working this way
2:03:00
forever. I distinguish them from the long-term debt cycle which typically plays out over 50 to 75 years and so
2:03:08
contains about 6 to 10 short-term debt cycles. By the way, please understand
2:03:14
that these rough estimates of cycle times are just rough estimates. And to know where we are in these cycles, we
2:03:20
need to look more at the conditions than the amount of time. Because the crises that occur as these long-term debt
2:03:28
cycles play out happen only once in a lifetime, most people don't expect them.
2:03:33
As a result, they typically take people by surprise and do a lot of harm. The
2:03:38
long-term debt cycle that is now in the late cycle phase was designed in 1944 in
2:03:44
Brettonwoods, New Hampshire, and began in 1945 when World War II ended and the
2:03:50
dollar US dominated world order began. These long-term debt cycles are driven
2:03:56
by the amount of stimulant left in the central bank's bottle. They start after previously existing excess debts have
2:04:03
been restructured and central banks have a full bottle of stimulant. They end
2:04:08
when debts are high and the bottle of stimulant is nearly empty or more specifically when the central bank loses
2:04:15
its ability to produce money and credit growth that passes through the economic system to produce real economic growth.
2:04:22
Throughout history, central governments and central banks have created money and credit, which weakened their own
2:04:28
currencies and raised their levels of monetary inflation to offset the deflation that comes from deflationary
2:04:35
credit and economic contractions. This typically happens when debt levels are high, interest rates can't be adequately
2:04:42
lowered, and the creation of money and credit increases financial asset prices more than it increases actual economic
2:04:49
activity. At such times, those who are holding the debt, which is someone else's promise to
2:04:55
give them currency, typically want to exchange the debt they are holding for other storeholds of wealth. Once it is
2:05:02
widely perceived that money and debt assets are no longer good storeholds of wealth, the long-term debt cycle is at
2:05:09
its end and a restructuring of the monetary system has to occur. Since these cycles are big deals
2:05:17
and have happened virtually everywhere for all of recorded history, we need to understand them and have timeless and
2:05:24
universal principles for dealing with them. Well, but most people, including many economists, don't even acknowledge
2:05:31
their existence. That's because to get a sample size of observations that is large and diverse enough to give one a
2:05:38
good understanding, one has to have studied them over many hundreds of years in many different countries. In part
2:05:45
two, we will do just that, examining the most important of these cycles across history and around the world with
2:05:51
reference to the timeless and universal mechanics of why money and credit work and fail to work as mediums of exchange
2:05:58
and storeholds of wealth. In this chapter, I will synthesize all those cases so I can show you how they work
2:06:06
archetypically. I will begin with the basics of the long-term debt cycle from way back when
2:06:12
and bring you up to the present, giving you the classic template. To be clear,
2:06:17
I'm not saying that all cases transpire exactly like this one, but I am saying that they almost all follow this pattern
2:06:27
closely. The long-term debt cycle. The long-term debt cycle
2:06:32
transpires in six stages. Stage one, it begins with a little or no
2:06:39
debt and b money being hard. The debt burdens from the last
2:06:45
cycle were largely wiped out by restructuring and debt monetization. And because of the consequences of these,
2:06:52
particularly inflation, there is a return to hard money like gold and silver and sometimes copper and other
2:06:58
metals like nickel or sometimes a link to a hard currency. For example, after
2:07:04
the destruction of debt and money in Germany's VHimar Republic, money became backed by gold denominated assets and
2:07:11
land and pegged to the dollar. And after its destruction in Argentina in the late 1980s, money became linked to the
2:07:18
dollar. At this stage, money being hard is important because no trust or credit
2:07:24
is required to carry out an exchange. Any transaction can be settled on the
2:07:29
spot, even if the buyer and seller are strangers or enemies. There's an old saying that gold is the only financial
2:07:37
asset that isn't someone else's liability. When you receive gold coins
2:07:42
from a buyer, you can melt them down and exchange the metal and still receive almost the same value as if you had
2:07:49
spent them. Unlike a debt asset like paper money, which is a promise to deliver value, which isn't much of a
2:07:55
promise given how easy it is to print, when countries are at war and there is no trust in their intentions or
2:08:01
abilities to pay, they can still pay in gold. So gold and to a lesser extent
2:08:07
silver can be used as both a safe medium of exchange and a safe storehold of
2:08:12
wealth. Stage two, then come claims on hard money, that is notes or paper money.
2:08:21
Because carrying a lot of metal money around is risky and inconvenient, and creating credit is attractive to both
2:08:27
lenders and borrowers, credible parties arise that put the hard money in a safe
2:08:33
place and issue paper claims on it. These parties came to be known as banks,
2:08:38
though they initially included all sorts of institutions that people trusted, such as temples in China.
2:08:45
Soon people treat these paper claims on money as if they are money itself. After
2:08:50
all, they can be redeemed for tangible money or used to buy things directly. This type of currency system is called a
2:08:57
linked currency system because the value of the currency is linked to the value of something, typically hard money such
2:09:04
as gold and silver. Stage three, then comes
2:09:09
increased debt. At first, there are the same number of claims on the hard money as there is
2:09:16
hard money in the bank. Then the holders of paper claims and the banks discover the wonders of credit and debt. Holders
2:09:23
of paper claims loan them to banks in exchange for interest payments. The banks like to do that because they can
2:09:30
lend the money to others who can pay a higher interest rate, allowing the banks to make a profit. Those who borrow from
2:09:36
the bank like it because it gives them buying power they didn't previously have. And the whole society likes it
2:09:43
because it leads asset prices and production to rise. Since everyone is happy with how things are going, they do
2:09:49
a lot of it. More lending and borrowing happens over and over again. Many times
2:09:54
there is a boom and the quantity of the claims on the money that is debt assets
2:09:59
rises relative to the amount of actual goods and services there are to buy. Eventually, the claims become much
2:10:06
larger than the actual hard money in the bank. Trouble approaches when there
2:10:11
isn't enough income to service one's debts, or when the amount of claims people are holding in the expectation
2:10:18
that they can sell them to get money to buy goods and services increases faster than the amount of goods and services by
2:10:25
an amount that makes the conversion from that debt asset, for example, a bond,
2:10:30
impossible. These two problems tend to come together. Concerning the first of these problems,
2:10:37
think of debt as negative earnings and a negative asset that eats up earnings because earnings have to go to pay it
2:10:44
and eats up other assets because other assets have to be sold to get the money to pay the debt. It is senior meaning it
2:10:53
gets paid before any other type of asset. So when incomes and the values of
2:10:58
assets fall, there is a need to cut expenditures and sell off assets to raise the needed cash. When that's not
2:11:05
enough, there needs to be a debt restructurings in which debts and debt burdens are reduced, which is
2:11:12
problematic for both the debtor and the creditor because one person's debts are another's assets. and or B the central
2:11:19
bank printing money paired with the central government handing out money and credit to fill in the holes in incomes
2:11:25
and balance sheets which is what is happening now. Stage four, then debt crises,
2:11:33
defaults and devaluations come which leads to the printing of money and the breaking of the link to hard money. As
2:11:41
for the second problem, this happens when holders of debt don't believe they are going to get adequate returns from
2:11:46
it relative to other storeholds of wealth and the costs of goods and services. Debt assets, for example,
2:11:53
bonds are held by investors who believe they are storeholds of wealth that can be sold to get money which can be used
2:12:00
to buy things. When holders of debt assets try to make the conversion to real money and real goods and services
2:12:07
and find out that they can't, a run occurs, by which I mean that lots of holders of that debt try to make the
2:12:14
conversion to money, goods, services, and other financial assets. The bank, regardless of whether it is a private
2:12:21
bank or a central bank, is then faced with the choice of allowing that flow of money out of the debt asset, which will
2:12:28
raise interest rates and cause the debt and economic problems to worsen, or of printing money in the form of issuing
2:12:34
bonds and buying enough of the bonds to prevent interest rates from rising and hopefully reverse the run out of them.
2:12:42
Inevitably, the central bank breaks the link, prints the money, and devalues it because not doing that causes an
2:12:49
intolerable deflationary depression. The key at this stage is to create enough
2:12:54
money and devaluation to offset the deflationary depression, but not so much as to produce an inflationary spiral.
2:13:02
When this is done well, I call it a beautiful deleveraging, which I describe more completely in my book, Principles
2:13:09
for Navigating Big Debt Crisis. Sometimes that buying works temporarily.
2:13:15
However, if the ratio of claims on money, debt assets, to the amount of hard money there is and the quantity of
2:13:22
goods and services there is to buy are too high, the bank is in a bind that it can't get out of. It simply doesn't have
2:13:29
enough hard money to meet the claims. When that happens to a central bank, it
2:13:35
has the choice either to default or to break the link to the hard money, print the money, and devalue it. Inevitably,
2:13:42
the central bank devalues. When these debt restructurings and currency devaluations are too big, they lead to
2:13:49
the breakdown and possible destruction of the monetary system. The more debt
2:13:55
that is claims on money and claims on goods and services there is, the more it will be necessary to devalue the money.
2:14:02
Remember there is always a limited amount of goods and services because the amount is constrained by the economy's
2:14:08
ability to produce. Also remember that as shown in our example of paper money being claims
2:14:15
on hard money, there is a limited amount of that hard money, for example, gold on
2:14:20
deposit. While the amount of paper money, the claims on that hard money and debt, the claims on that paper money is
2:14:28
constantly growing. As the amount of paper money claims grows relative to the
2:14:33
amount of hard money in the bank and goods and services in the economy, the risk increases that the holders of those
2:14:39
debt assets may not be able to redeem them for the amounts of hard money or goods and services that they expect to
2:14:46
receive for them. A bank that can't deliver enough hard money to meet the claims being made on
2:14:52
it is in trouble whether it is a private bank or a central bank. Though central
2:14:57
banks have more options than private banks. That's because a private bank can't print the money or change the laws
2:15:04
to make it easier to pay their debts while some central banks can. Private banks must either default
2:15:10
or get bailed out by the government when they get into trouble while central banks can devalue their claims. for
2:15:16
example, pay back 50 to 70% if their debts are denominated in their national
2:15:21
currency. If the debt is denominated in a currency that they can't print, then they too must ultimately
2:15:29
default. Stage five, then comes fiat money, which eventually leads to the
2:15:34
debasement of money. Central banks want to stretch the money and credit cycle to make it last
2:15:41
for as long as it can because that is so much better than the alternative. So when the system of hard money and claims
2:15:47
on hard money becomes too painfully constrictive, governments typically abandon it in favor of what is called
2:15:54
fiat money. No hard money is involved in fiat systems. There is just paper money
2:16:00
that the central bank can print without restriction. As a result, there is no risk that the central bank will have its
2:16:07
stash of hard money drawn down and have to default on its promises to deliver it. Rather the risk is that freed from
2:16:14
the constraints on the supply of tangible gold, silver or some other hard asset, the people who control the
2:16:21
printing presses, that is the central bankers working with the commercial bankers, will create ever more money and
2:16:28
debt assets and liabilities in relation to the amount of goods and services being produced. until the time comes
2:16:34
when those holding the enormous amount of debt will try to turn it in for goods and services which will have the same
2:16:40
effect as a run on a bank and result in either debt defaults or the devaluation of
2:16:46
money. The shift from a system in which the debt notes are convertible to a tangible asset, for example, gold and
2:16:53
silver at a fixed rate to a fiat monetary system in which there is no such convertability last happened in the
2:17:01
US on the evening of August 15th, 1971. As I mentioned earlier, I was
2:17:06
watching on TV when President Nixon told the world that the dollar would no longer be tied to gold. I thought there
2:17:13
would be pandemonium with stocks falling. Instead, they rose because I
2:17:19
had never seen a devaluation before. I didn't understand how it works. In the
2:17:24
years leading up to 1971, the US government had spent a lot of money on military and social programs, then
2:17:31
referred to as guns and butter policy that it paid for by borrowing money, which created debt. The debt was a claim
2:17:38
on money that could be exchanged for gold. Investors treated this debt as an
2:17:43
asset because they got paid interest on it and because the US government promised that it would allow the holders
2:17:49
of those notes to exchange them for the gold that was held in US vaults. As the
2:17:54
spending and budget deficits grew, the US had to issue much more debt, that is
2:18:00
create many more claims on gold. Even though the amount of gold in the bank didn't increase, investors who were
2:18:07
astute enough to notice could see that the amount of outstanding claims on gold was much larger than the amount of gold
2:18:13
in the bank. They realized that if this continued, the US would have to default.
2:18:19
So they turned in their claims. Of course, the idea that the US government, the richest and most powerful government
2:18:25
in the world, would default on its promise to give gold to those who had claims on it seemed implausible at the
2:18:32
time. So, while most people were surprised by Nixon's announcement and the effects on the markets, those who
2:18:38
understood the mechanics of how money and credit work were not. When credit cycles reach their limit, it
2:18:46
is the logical and classic response for central governments and their central banks to create a lot of debt and print
2:18:53
money that will be spent on goods, services, and investment assets in order to keep the economy moving. That was
2:18:59
done during the 2008 debt crisis when interest rates could no longer be lowered because they had already hit
2:19:06
0%. It also happened in a big way in 2020 in response to the plunge triggered
2:19:11
by the co pandemic. That was also done in response to the 192932 debt crisis when interest rates
2:19:19
had similarly been driven to 0%. At the time I'm writing this, the creation of debt and money has been
2:19:26
happening in amounts greater than at any time since World War II. To be clear,
2:19:31
printing money and giving it out for spending rather than supporting spending with debt growth is not without its
2:19:37
benefits. Money spends like credit, but in practice rather than in theory, it
2:19:43
doesn't have to be paid back. There's nothing wrong with having an increase in money growth instead of an increase in
2:19:49
credit debt growth. If the money is put to productive use, the risk is that it
2:19:54
will not be. If money is printed too aggressively and it is not used productively, people will stop using it
2:20:01
as a storehold of wealth and shift their wealth into other things. History has shown that we shouldn't rely
2:20:08
on governments to protect us financially. On the contrary, we should expect most governments to abuse their
2:20:15
privileged positions as the creators and users of money and credit for the same reasons that you might commit those
2:20:21
abuses if you were in their shoes. That is because no one policymaker owns the
2:20:27
whole cycle. Each comes in at one or another part of it and does what is in
2:20:32
their interest to do given their circumstances at the time and what they believe is best, including breaking
2:20:38
promises, even though the way they collectively handle the whole cycle is bad. Since early in the debt cycle,
2:20:46
governments are considered trustworthy and they need and want money as much as or more than anyone else does, they are
2:20:52
typically the biggest borrowers. Later in the cycle, new government leaders and new central bankers have to face the
2:20:59
challenge of paying back debts with less stimulant in the bottle. To make matters worse, governments also have to bail out
2:21:06
debtors whose failures would hurt the system, the too big to fail syndrome. As
2:21:12
a result, they tend to get themselves into cash flow jams that are much larger than those of individuals, companies,
2:21:18
and most other entities. In virtually every case, the government contributes to the accumulation of debt
2:21:25
with its actions and by becoming a large debtor itself. When the debt bubble
2:21:31
bursts, the government bails itself and others out by buying assets and/or printing money and devaluing it. The
2:21:38
larger the debt crisis, the more that is true. While undesirable, it is understandable why this happens. When
2:21:45
one can manufacture money and credit and pass them out to everyone to make them happy, it is very hard to resist the
2:21:52
temptation to do so. Some central banks have made acting on this temptation
2:21:57
harder by separating themselves from the direct control of politicians, but virtually every central bank has to bail
2:22:04
out their government at some point. So, devaluations always happen. It is a
2:22:10
classic financial move. Throughout history, rulers have run up debts that won't come due until long after their
2:22:17
own reigns are over, leaving it to their successors to pay the bill. Printing money and buying
2:22:23
financial assets, mostly bonds, holds interest rates down, which stimulates
2:22:28
borrowing and buying. Those investors holding bonds are encouraged to sell them. The low interest rates also
2:22:35
encourage investors, businesses, and individuals to borrow and invest in high returning assets, getting what they want
2:22:42
through monthly payments they can afford. This leads central banks to print more money and buy more bonds and
2:22:49
sometimes other financial assets. That typically does a good job of pushing up
2:22:54
financial asset prices, but is relatively inefficient at getting money, credit, and buying power into the hands
2:23:00
of those who need them most. That is what happened in 2008 and what happened
2:23:05
for most of the time until the 2020 corona virus induced crisis. When money
2:23:11
printing and purchasing of financial assets failed to get money and credit to where they need to go, the central
2:23:17
government borrows money from the central bank which prints it so the government can spend it on what it needs
2:23:23
to be spent on. The Fed announced that plan on April 9th, 2020. That approach
2:23:29
of printing money to buy debt, called debt monetization, is vastly more politically palatable as a way of
2:23:36
shifting wealth from those who have it to those who need it than imposing taxes
2:23:41
because those who are taxed get angry. That is why central banks always end up
2:23:46
printing money and devaluing. When governments print a lot of money and buy a lot of debt, they
2:23:53
cheapen both, which essentially taxes those who own it, making it easier for debtors and borrowers. When this happens
2:23:59
to the point that the holders of money and debt assets realize what is going on, they seek to sell their debt assets
2:24:06
and or borrow money to get into debt they can pay back with cheap money. They
2:24:11
also often move their wealth into better storeholds such as gold and certain types of stocks or to another country
2:24:17
not having these problems. At such time, central banks have typically continued to print money and
2:24:23
buy debt directly or indirectly. For example, by having banks do the buying for them while outlawing the flow of
2:24:29
money into inflation, hedge assets, alternative currencies, and alternative places.
2:24:35
Such periods of reflation either stimulate a new money and credit expansion that finances another economic
2:24:42
expansion which is good for stocks or devalue the money so that it produces
2:24:47
monetary inflation which is good for inflation hedge assets such as gold, commodities and inflation linked bonds.
2:24:55
Earlier in the long-term debt cycle, when the amount of outstanding debt isn't large and there is a lot of room
2:25:01
to stimulate by lowering interest rates and failing that, printing money and buying financial assets, there is a
2:25:08
strong likelihood that credit growth and economic growth will be good. Later in the long-term debt cycle, when the
2:25:14
amount of debt is large and there isn't much room to stimulate, there is a much greater likelihood of monetary inflation
2:25:21
accompanied by economic weakness. While people tend to believe that a
2:25:26
currency is pretty much a permanent thing and that cash is the safest asset to hold, that's not true. All currencies
2:25:34
devalue or die. And when they do, cash and bonds, which are promises to receive currency, are devalued or wiped out.
2:25:42
That is because printing a lot of currency and devaluing debt is the most expedient way of reducing or wiping out
2:25:49
debt burdens. When debt burdens are sufficiently reduced or eliminated, the
2:25:54
credit debt expansion cycles can begin again as described in the next chapter. As I explained comprehensively
2:26:02
in my book, Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crisis, there are four levers that policymakers can pull to bring debt
2:26:10
and debt service levels down relative to the income and cash flow levels required to service debts. One, austerity,
2:26:18
spending less. Two, debt defaults and restructurings. Three, transfers of
2:26:25
money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less than they need, for example,
2:26:31
raising taxes. Four, printing money and devaluing it. These levers typically
2:26:38
progress from one to another for logical reasons. Austerity is deflationary and
2:26:44
doesn't last long because it's too painful. Debt defaults and restructurings are
2:26:50
also deflationary and painful because the debts that are wiped out or reduced in value are someone's
2:26:56
assets. As a result, defaults and restructurings are painful for both the debtor who goes broke and has their
2:27:02
assets taken away and for the creditor who loses wealth when the debt is written
2:27:08
down. Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less than they need. For
2:27:14
example, raising taxes to redistribute wealth is politically challenging but more tolerable than the first two ways
2:27:21
and is typically part of the resolution. Compared to the others, printing money is the most expedient,
2:27:27
least well understood, and most common big way of restructuring debts. In fact,
2:27:33
it seems good rather than bad to most people because it helps to relieve debt
2:27:38
squeezes. It's tough to identify any harmed parties that the wealth was taken
2:27:43
away from to provide this financial wealth, though they are the holders of money and debt assets. In most cases, it
2:27:51
causes assets to go up in the depreciating currency that people measure their wealth in. So, it appears
2:27:56
that people are getting richer. This is what has been happening during the Corona virus crisis as
2:28:02
central governments and banks send out large amounts of money and credit. Note that you don't hear anyone complaining
2:28:09
about the money and credit creation. In fact, people say that governments would be cheap and cruel if they didn't
2:28:15
provide a lot more of it. Hardly anyone acknowledges that governments don't actually have this money to give out.
2:28:22
Governments aren't rich entities with piles of money lying around. They are just their people collectively who will
2:28:29
ultimately have to pay for the creation and giving out of money. Now, imagine what those same citizens would say if
2:28:35
government officials cut expenses to balance their budgets and ask them to do the same, making lots of them go broke
2:28:42
and/or if they sought to redistribute wealth from those who have more to those
2:28:47
who have less by raising taxes. The money and credit producing path is much
2:28:53
more acceptable politically than either of those options. It's as if you changed the rules of monopoly to allow the
2:28:59
banker to make more money and redistribute it whenever too many players are going broke and getting
2:29:06
angry. Stage six, then the flight back into hard money. When taken too far, the
2:29:14
overprinting of fiat currency leads to the selling of debt assets and the earlier described bankr run dynamic
2:29:21
which ultimately reduces the value of money and credit which prompts people to flee out of both the currency and the
2:29:27
debt. History teaches us that people typically turn to gold, silver, stocks that maintain their real value and
2:29:35
currencies and assets in other countries not having these problems. Some people think that there has to be an
2:29:41
alternative reserve currency to go to for this flight to happen. But that's not true. As the same dynamic of the
2:29:48
breakdown of the monetary system and the running to other assets has happened in cases in which there was no alternative
2:29:54
currency, for example, in dynastic China and during the Roman Empire.
2:30:00
There are a lot of things people run to when money is devalued, including rocks used for construction in Germany's
2:30:07
VHimar Republic. The debasement of the currency leads people to run from it and
2:30:13
from debt denomination in it and into something else. At this stage of the debt cycle,
2:30:19
there is typically economic stress caused by large wealth and value gaps. These gaps lead to higher taxes and
2:30:26
fighting between the rich and the poor. This also makes those with wealth want to move to hard assets, other currencies
2:30:33
and other countries. Naturally, those who are governing the countries that are suffering from this flight from their
2:30:39
debt, their currency and their country want to stop it. So, governments make it harder to invest in assets like gold by
2:30:47
outlawing gold transactions and ownership, for example. foreign currencies via eliminating the ability
2:30:53
to transact in them and foreign countries by establishing foreign exchange controls to prevent money from
2:31:00
leaving the country. Eventually, the debt is largely wiped out, usually by making the money
2:31:06
to pay it back plentiful and cheap, which devalues both the money and the debt. When the devaluations and defaults
2:31:14
become so extreme that the money and credit system breaks down, necessity generally compels governments to go back
2:31:21
to some form of hard currency to rebuild people's faith in the value of money as a storehold of wealth. Quite often,
2:31:28
though not always, the government links its money to gold or a hard reserve currency with a promise to allow holders
2:31:35
of that new money to convert it to the hard money. Sometimes that hard money is
2:31:40
in other countries. For example, over the past decades, many weak currency countries have linked their money to the
2:31:46
US dollar or simply dollarized their economy, that is, use the dollar as
2:31:51
their own medium of exchange and storehold of wealth. To review, holding debt as an
2:31:58
asset that provides interest is typically rewarding early in the long-term debt cycle when there isn't a
2:32:04
lot of debt outstanding. But holding debt late in the cycle when there is a lot of debt outstanding and it is closer
2:32:10
to being defaulted on or devalued is risky relative to the interest rate being given. So holding debt is a bit
2:32:17
like holding a ticking time bomb that rewards you while it is still ticking and blows you up when it stops. And as
2:32:25
we've seen that big blowup that is big default or big devaluation happens
2:32:30
something like once every 50 to 75 years. These cycles of building debts and
2:32:36
writing off debts have existed for thousands of years and in some cases have been
2:32:42
institutionalized. For example, the Old Testament describes a year of Jubilee every 50 years in which debts were
2:32:49
forgiven. Knowing that the debt cycle would happen on that schedule allowed everyone to act in a rational way to
2:32:55
prepare for it. Helping you understand this debt cycle so that you are prepared for it rather than surprised by it is my
2:33:03
main objective in writing this book. Ironically, the closer most people are to the blowup, which is also when the
2:33:10
claims outstanding are largest relative to the amount of hard money and tangible wealth there is, the riskier the
2:33:17
situation is, but the safer people tend to feel. That is because they have held
2:33:23
the debt and enjoyed the rewards of doing so. The longer it has been since the last blow up, the more people's
2:33:29
memories of it have faded. Even as the risks of holding the debt rise and the rewards for holding it
2:33:36
decline, to properly assess the riskreward of holding the time bomb, one
2:33:41
must remain constantly aware of the amount of debt that needs to be paid relative to the amount of hard money
2:33:47
there is to pay it, the amount of debt payments that have to be made relative to the amount of cash flow the debtors
2:33:53
have, and the amount of interest they bring in.
2:33:58
The long-term debt cycle. In summary, for thousands of years, there
2:34:03
have always been three types of monetary systems. Type one, hard money, for
2:34:09
example, metal coins. Type two, paper money, claims on hard money. Type three,
2:34:17
fiat money. Hard money is the most restrictive system because money can't be created
2:34:23
unless the supply of the metal or other intrinsically valuable commodity that is the money is increased. Money and credit
2:34:30
are more easily created in the second type of system. So the ratio of the claims on hard money to the actual hard
2:34:37
money held rises which eventually leads to a run on the banks. The result is a
2:34:43
defaults when the bank closes its doors and depositors lose their hard assets and or b devaluations of the claims on
2:34:50
money which mean depositors get back less. In the third type of system, governments can create money and credit
2:34:57
freely which works for as long as people continue to have confidence in the currency and fails when they no longer
2:35:05
do. Throughout history, countries have transitioned across these different types of systems for logical reasons.
2:35:12
When a country needs more money and credit than it currently has, whether to deal with debts, wars, or other
2:35:18
problems, it naturally moves from type 1 to type two or type two to type three so
2:35:23
that it has more flexibility to print money. Then creating too much money and
2:35:28
debt depreciates their value, causing people to get out of holding debt and money as a storehold of wealth and move
2:35:35
back into hard assets like gold and silver and other currencies. Since this typically takes place when there is
2:35:41
wealth conflict and sometimes war, there is also typically a desire to get out of the country. Such countries need to
2:35:48
reestablish confidence in their currency as a storehold of wealth before they can restore their credit markets.
2:35:56
The next PDF diagram conveys these different transitions. There are many historical examples from the Song
2:36:02
Dynasty in China to VHimar Germany of countries making the full transition from constrained types of monetary
2:36:09
systems type 1 and type two to fiat money type three then back to a
2:36:14
constrained currency as the fiat currency hyperinflates. This big cycle typically
2:36:21
plays out over something like 50 to 75 years. Its ending is characterized by a
2:36:27
restructuring of debts and the monetary system itself. The abrupt parts of these
2:36:32
restructurings, that is the periods of debt and currency crisis, typically
2:36:37
happen quickly, lasting only a few months to up to 3 years depending on how long it takes the government to act.
2:36:44
However, their ripple effects can be longlasting. For example, when a currency ceases to be a reserve
2:36:51
currency. Within each of these currency regimes, there are typically two to four big debt crises. That is big enough to
2:36:59
cause banking crises and debt write downs or devaluations of 30% or more,
2:37:05
but not big enough to break the currency system. Because I have invested in many
2:37:10
countries for nearly half a century, I have experienced dozens of them. They all run the same way, which I explain in
2:37:17
greater depth in my book, Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crisis.
2:37:22
In the next chapter, I will go into more detail on the causes of and risks associated with money changing its
2:37:28
value, showing what has happened in the past, which is pretty shocking. That
