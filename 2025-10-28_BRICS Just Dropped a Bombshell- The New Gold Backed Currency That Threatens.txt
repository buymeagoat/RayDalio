Decades from now, people will look back
0:05
at this week and say this was the moment
0:07
the world changed. Not through war or
0:09
crisis, but through a quiet announcement
0:12
in Moscow. An alliance of nations just
0:15
declared they no longer want to trade in
0:17
paper promises. They want money backed
0:20
by something real. When I first heard
0:22
the news, I thought of all the cycles I
0:25
have studied. Empires rise because their
0:29
money is trusted. They fall when that
0:31
trust fades. The bricks announcement may
0:34
look technical, but beneath it sits a
0:36
deeper signal. The signal that the world
0:39
is losing faith in the US dollar. At the
0:42
2025 Moscow Financial Forum, the BRICS
0:45
nations, Brazil, Russia, India, China,
0:49
South Africa unveiled a plan for a
0:52
precious metals exchange. They will
0:55
anchor trade in gold, platinum, and
0:59
other tangible resources. No printing
1:02
presses, no unlimited credit. A currency
1:06
system built on what the earth produces,
1:09
not on what governments promise. This is
1:12
not symbolism. It is structure. And
1:16
structure decides power. The bricks
1:19
block now represents nearly half of
1:22
humanity. They produce over onethird of
1:26
global output.
1:28
Four of the top 10 holders of foreign
1:31
exchange reserves are in that group.
1:33
When you combine those resources, energy
1:36
manufacturing population, you have
1:39
leverage
1:41
and they are using that leverage to free
1:44
themselves from the dollar system. For
1:47
decades, the world operated on a simple
1:50
rule. trade in dollars, store reserves
1:53
in US debt, trust the American system.
1:56
That rule gave the United States
1:58
enormous privilege. It could borrow
2:00
cheaply. It could sanction rivals by
2:04
freezing their dollar assets. And it
2:06
could run deficits without immediate
2:09
pain because demand for dollars never
2:11
stopped. But the foundation of that
2:13
privilege was belief. Belief that the
2:17
dollar was stable. belief that the
2:20
system was fair. Once belief shifts,
2:24
everything else follows. In Moscow, the
2:27
BRICS leaders showed they no longer
2:29
share that belief. They created their
2:31
own metals exchange to settle trade
2:33
outside of Western networks like Swift.
2:36
Payments will move through their own
2:38
channels. Prices will be set by their
2:41
own markets. Audits will be transparent
2:44
based on tangible reserves. Russia
2:47
prepared for this for years. Their
2:49
finance ministry had discussed such an
2:51
exchange since 2024. Now integrated with
2:55
China's CP's payment system, it exists.
2:59
This is not a theory. It is
3:01
infrastructure.
3:02
Why does this matter to you? Because the
3:06
money you hold, the prices you pay, and
3:09
the returns you earn are all tied to
3:11
confidence in that old system. If
3:13
confidence erodess, the ground beneath
3:15
those numbers shifts. Today about 80% of
3:19
global foreign exchange trades involve
3:21
the dollar. Roughly 58% of global
3:25
reserves are in US assets. Those figures
3:28
used to be higher. They are falling.
3:32
Each trade settled in yuan, rubble or
3:34
rupee is one less dollar in circulation.
3:37
I have seen this pattern before. When
3:40
Britain's pound dominated global trade,
3:42
it felt permanent. Then came debt, war
3:47
and inflation. By the midgative -20th
3:50
century, the world had moved to dollars.
3:54
The cycle turned. Now the same
3:56
indicators appear again. The BRICS
3:58
alliance is not chasing ideology. It is
4:02
pursuing independence.
4:04
They saw what happened when the West
4:06
froze Russia's reserves. They saw how
4:09
quickly digital dollars can become
4:11
digital weapons. So they are building a
4:14
parallel system that cannot be turned
4:16
off. Think about the scale of this
4:19
shift. These countries hold over 1200
4:24
tons of gold. They control 70% of rare
4:28
earth minerals, 40% of the world's oil.
4:32
If those commodities begin trading
4:34
through their exchange, the dollar loses
4:37
its anchor. When pricing moves, behavior
4:40
moves. If oil is quoted in bricks tokens
4:44
instead of dollars, importers will no
4:47
longer need dollar reserves. If metals
4:50
are priced in gold equivalents,
4:53
producers will settle in tangible
4:54
assets. Demand for US debt will drop.
4:58
Interest rates could rise. Inflation
5:01
could grow as the US must print more to
5:04
finance its deficits. You might think
5:06
the dollar's position is unshakable. And
5:10
for now, its scale remains unmatched.
5:13
Liquidity, legal safety, global trust
5:17
built over decades. Those strengths will
5:20
not vanish overnight. But every
5:23
structural shift begins small. And the
5:26
first signal is already flashing. The
5:28
brick's plan is not to print a new fiat
5:32
currency. It is to back trade with
5:36
physical resources. Each settlement
5:39
token will represent measurable value.
5:42
Gold, platinum, or rare minerals. A
5:46
modern gold standard built for digital
5:48
trade. Technically, it works through
5:50
blockchain like networks. Transactions
5:53
clear in minutes. No central
5:55
intermediary. Imagine India paying
5:58
Russia for oil not with dollars but
6:01
through a bricks digital system. The
6:03
gold equivalent transfers instantly. No
6:06
swift message, no US oversight. That is
6:11
the architecture of independence. In
6:13
real life, such systems take years to
6:17
scale. But every institution begins with
6:20
one decision. The decision to stop
6:22
relying on someone else's rules. That is
6:25
what we witnessed in Moscow. I remember
6:28
studying the 1970s gold crisis. When the
6:31
US left the gold standard, it freed its
6:34
monetary policy, but also unanchankered
6:36
global trust. For decades, that freedom
6:39
fueled expansion. But it also created
6:42
cycles of boom and bust tied to credit.
6:45
Now, another group of nations is
6:47
reversing that choice, returning to real
6:50
assets. They believe stability comes
6:53
from scarcity, not from flexibility.
6:55
Gold prices this fall reached record
6:58
highs over $400
7:02
an ounce. That is not random
7:04
speculation. It reflects structural
7:07
demand from central banks seeking
7:09
insurance. They have bought over 10 tons
7:12
a year since 2022.
7:14
Those purchases are silent votes against
7:16
the dollar's permanence. In Washington,
7:19
the reaction was predictable. Leaders
7:21
called the bricks plan an attack on the
7:23
dollar. They threaten tariffs and
7:26
isolation, but coercion often
7:28
accelerates the trend it fears. Each
7:31
attempt to punish non-doll trade pushes
7:34
others to build alternatives. Moscow
7:37
replied calmly. Their spokesman said the
7:40
move was defensive, not aggressive. He
7:43
was right. When one system punishes, the
7:47
other adapts. Markets read between the
7:50
lines. Gold rallied. Dollar bonds
7:53
wobbled. Investors hedged currency risk
7:57
across portfolios. Over 80% of global
8:00
equity inflows are now dollar hedged. It
8:03
tells you confidence is still there. But
8:05
caution has entered the room. The story
8:08
of money is the story of trust. When
8:11
trust compounds, economies expand. When
8:15
trust decays, people return to what
8:18
feels safe. Gold is not mystical. It is
8:22
psychological.
8:24
It is the fall back when words lose
8:27
value. The bricks move is not the end of
8:30
the dollar, but it may mark the
8:33
beginning of its gradual transformation
8:35
from monopoly to peer. A world of
8:38
several currencies competing for trust.
8:41
I have learned that systems rarely break
8:43
in one blow. They erode quietly, piece
8:47
by piece. This is one of those moments
8:50
when you study history, you start to
8:52
notice how often power shifts follow
8:55
money. Empires do not fall when armies
8:59
lose battles. They fall when their
9:01
currency loses credibility. That is why
9:05
this announcement matters. Because it is
9:08
not only a trade move, it is a
9:10
credibility move. For decades, the
9:14
United States has financed its
9:16
leadership through debt. The world
9:18
accepted those debts because it trusted
9:21
the dollar. It trusted that the US would
9:24
manage its money responsibly. But as
9:26
debt climbs and deficits grow, others
9:29
begin asking a question I have asked
9:31
many times. What happens when confidence
9:34
runs out? When I look at the numbers, I
9:37
see patterns that resemble the late
9:40
stages of past empires. The total US
9:43
debt has surpassed $34 trillion.
9:46
The cost of servicing that debt now
9:50
rivals national defense spending.
9:52
Meanwhile, central banks around the
9:54
world are diversifying. They are buying
9:57
gold. They are reducing dollar reserves.
10:02
That is how change begins quietly in
10:06
balance sheets. The BRICS nations
10:08
understand this dynamic. They have lived
10:11
through currency crisis. They know what
10:14
happens when value evaporates. So they
10:17
are taking preventive action. They are
10:20
building a new framework before the next
10:24
shock arrives. Their new system works
10:26
like this. Instead of relying on a
10:29
single global reserve currency, they are
10:32
creating a closed loop ecosystem.
10:35
A digital platform connects their banks.
10:39
Payments clear instantly in metals or
10:42
local currencies. Data is transparent.
10:46
Every transaction backed by a resource.
10:51
The technical foundation uses blockchain
10:54
like ledgers. That means settlement
10:56
happens in minutes not days. It also
11:00
means western institutions cannot
11:02
monitor or freeze it. for BRICS members.
11:05
That is not only convenience, it is
11:08
security. Imagine Argentina selling
11:11
soybeans to China. Instead of demanding
11:15
dollars, China pays through the new
11:17
platform. The payment is tied to gold
11:20
stored in Shanghai or Moscow. Argentina
11:23
receives its value instantly without
11:26
touching Swift. No conversion risk, no
11:29
political friction. That small
11:32
transaction multiplied millions of times
11:36
builds a new reality over time. The need
11:40
for dollar settlements fades. And once
11:43
the habit breaks, it rarely returns.
11:46
When I talk to policy makers, they often
11:48
underestimate this psychological shift.
11:51
They look at numbers but not at
11:53
behavior. But behavior drives the cycle.
11:56
When traders, central banks and
11:58
corporations start thinking in
12:00
alternative units, the old unit loses
12:03
gravity. Goldback trade is appealing for
12:07
a simple reason. It feels fair. It has
12:10
weight. It removes the perception that
12:13
one nation can print wealth while others
12:15
must earn it. And fairness is a powerful
12:18
economic motivator. Of course, creating
12:21
a new system is not easy. The BRICS
12:24
countries have different interests.
12:26
China wants to expand its payment
12:28
network. Russia wants independence from
12:31
sanctions. India wants stability. Brazil
12:34
wants fair trade terms. These
12:36
differences will slow progress. But even
12:40
slow progress changes expectations. In
12:43
my research, I have seen two types of
12:46
transitions. smooth transitions where
12:49
the old and new systems coexist for
12:51
years and abrupt ones where a crisis
12:55
forces a rapid change. Which one happens
12:58
next will depend on policy choices. If
13:01
the United States manages its debt
13:03
carefully, reforms spending and rebuilds
13:06
trust. The transition could be gradual.
13:10
The world would slowly become multipolar
13:13
with the dollar sharing space alongside
13:15
other assets. But if politics blocks
13:18
reform and deficits keep growing,
13:20
pressure will build faster. At some
13:23
point, markets will decide that the old
13:25
structure no longer fits reality. I have
13:27
lived through moments like that. In the
13:30
1970s, the US faced stagflation and debt
13:34
overhang. Confidence in the dollar fell
13:36
sharply. Gold prices exploded. It took
13:40
years and painful rate hikes to restore
13:43
stability. We could be entering a
13:45
similar period now with the added
13:48
complexity of digital finance and
13:50
competing systems. Washington's reaction
13:53
so far has been defensive threats of
13:56
tariffs, warnings against joining
13:59
bricks. But power does not return
14:02
through force. It returns through
14:04
credibility. If you lose trust, you must
14:08
earn it back through discipline. That
14:10
lesson repeats across centuries. The
14:13
Kremlin's response was calm because they
14:15
know time favors them. Every year, trade
14:18
within bricks grows faster than global
14:21
trade. Every year, their share of gold
14:24
and commodity reserves increases. They
14:27
can afford to wait while the West argues
14:30
about deficits. The dollar's dominance
14:33
has lasted a century because of one
14:35
factor, confidence. People trusted the
14:39
United States to protect value, maintain
14:41
order, and enforce law. But trust decays
14:45
when systems stop rewarding prudence.
14:48
When inflation quietly erodess savings,
14:52
when fiscal debates turn into political
14:54
theater, when debt becomes normal, that
14:57
is where we are now. A moment of gradual
15:00
disbelief. Investors are not fleeing the
15:04
dollar, but they are hedging it. Central
15:06
banks are not abandoning US treasuries,
15:09
but they are buying less, and the rest
15:12
of the world is testing alternatives. If
15:15
the bricks exchange succeeds even
15:18
modestly, it could reshape capital
15:20
flows. Countries that sell commodities
15:23
may start saving in gold or digital
15:26
metals. Nations that buy energy may pay
15:30
in resource tokens instead of green
15:32
paper. Each transaction shifts reserves
15:36
slightly away from the dollar. Step by
15:39
step, the world diversifies.
15:41
In markets, perception often becomes
15:44
reality. If investors believe the dollar
15:47
is weakening, they act accordingly. They
15:50
buy assets that hedge inflation. They
15:53
hold more commodities. They demand
15:56
higher yields for lending. Those
15:59
behaviors create the very weakness they
16:01
fear. That is why I watch sentiment as
16:04
closely as I watch data. In my
16:07
experience, the shift in tone always
16:09
precedes the shift in numbers. Right
16:12
now, sentiment is turning quietly when
16:15
gold crosses $4. Oh, zero. When bricks
16:19
announces a metals back settlement
16:22
system, when investors hedge 80% of
16:24
their dollar exposure. All these are
16:27
whispers of the same message. Trust is
16:30
adjusting. No change of this magnitude
16:33
happens cleanly. There will be
16:36
volatility.
16:37
There will be political friction. But
16:40
volatility is how systems search for new
16:43
equilibrium. The dollar is still
16:45
powerful, but its premium is no longer
16:48
guaranteed. As other currencies gain
16:51
ground, yields on us. Assets may rise to
16:54
attract investors. That will affect
16:57
borrowing costs, real estate, and equity
17:00
valuations. Everything priced in dollars
17:03
adjusts when its foundation shifts. For
17:06
most people, this transition will not
17:09
feel immediate. You will not wake up one
17:12
morning and find the dollar gone. But
17:14
you might notice groceries costing more
17:17
or interest rates staying high or gold
17:20
quietly outperforming stocks. Those are
17:23
the small signs of a larger
17:25
transformation. History shows that every
17:28
financial order ends the way it began.
17:32
With innovation, the US built its power
17:35
on a new kind of money after World War
17:37
II. Now, others are building theirs on a
17:41
new kind of digital metal. The tools are
17:43
different, but the principle is the
17:45
same. Trust flows to systems that
17:48
deliver value without deception. In the
17:52
near term, the United States can still
17:54
adapt. It can strengthen its fiscal
17:56
position. It can cooperate with emerging
18:00
systems instead of fighting them. But
18:02
that requires humility. It requires
18:05
admitting that dominance is temporary
18:07
and leadership must be earned again.
18:10
Most people misunderstand cycles. They
18:13
think collapse means the end. But
18:16
decline is only part of the rhythm. When
18:20
one power contracts,
18:22
another expands. When one currency
18:25
fades, another rises. This is not chaos.
18:30
It is evolution. We are witnessing that
18:33
evolution in real time. Not through
18:37
explosions or headlines, but through
18:39
slow, deliberate construction, a new
18:41
payment system here, a new metals
18:44
exchanged there, a quiet diversification
18:47
of reserves. Piece by piece, the
18:50
architecture of the next global order is
18:52
being built. When people ask what
18:55
happens next, I tell them this. It
18:58
depends on how nations respond to
19:00
reality. The United States has the
19:02
advantage of deep capital markets and
19:04
trust built over generations. But
19:07
advantages decay when they are taken for
19:10
granted. Analysts now see two main
19:13
paths. One is gradual adjustment. The
19:16
other is confrontation. In the gradual
19:19
path, the world becomes multipolar
19:23
without crisis. Trade continues, but in
19:26
more currencies. Central banks diversify
19:29
their reserves. Gold plays a larger role
19:32
as a neutral anchor. The dollar remains
19:35
important but not absolute. This path is
19:38
slow, manageable, and largely peaceful.
19:42
In the confrontational path, politics
19:45
dominates economics. Tariffs rise,
19:48
capital flows freeze, nations weaponize
19:52
money, trust breaks faster than systems
19:55
can adapt. That is when crisis happen.
19:59
Which path we take depends on leadership
20:02
and selfawareness.
20:04
Every empire I studied reached this
20:06
stage.
20:09
Rome debased its currency. Britain
20:12
overspent to maintain its empire. Each
20:15
time the cost of living rose faster than
20:18
wages, people grew anxious. Politics
20:22
turned inward and while they argued a
20:25
new power quietly organized itself
20:27
elsewhere. That is what bricks
20:30
represents today. The group is not
20:32
unified by ideology. It is unified by
20:36
necessity. When one system dominates too
20:39
long, alternatives are born. When one
20:43
currency controls everything, others
20:45
eventually resist. That is the nature of
20:48
balance. If you are watching from the
20:51
outside, this might feel abstract. But
20:54
the consequences will touch your daily
20:57
life. Inflation, interest rates, housing
21:00
costs, and investment returns all depend
21:02
on currency trust. When that trust
21:05
shifts, prices shift. That is why
21:08
awareness matters. So what should you
21:11
do? The same thing nations do.
21:14
Diversify. Do not hold all your savings
21:17
in one asset or one currency. Consider
21:21
owning some gold or silver. History
21:24
shows that even small allocations reduce
21:27
losses during currency resets. Central
21:30
banks have been doing exactly that. They
21:33
bought more than 244 tons of gold in the
21:36
first quarter of 2025. They are
21:39
signaling caution when the largest
21:41
institutions in the world hedge against
21:44
the system they help build. That is
21:46
worth noting. Diversify your currencies.
21:50
Hold some euros or yen or invest in
21:53
assets that produce real value.
21:56
Companies, land, energy. Money is only a
22:00
claim on value. When the claim weakens,
22:03
value itself becomes your protection.
22:05
Hedge your exposures. If you own foreign
22:09
investments, use currency hedged funds.
22:13
Large institutions are already doing
22:15
this. Over 80% of US equity inflows are
22:20
now hedged. That tells you global
22:22
investors are still participating, but
22:24
they are not fully trusting. Spread your
22:27
assets geographically. The next growth
22:30
cycle may not come from the same regions
22:32
as before. Emerging markets, especially
22:35
resource rich nations, could benefit
22:38
from this new structure. But always
22:41
balance risk. No one knows which system
22:44
will dominate next. That uncertainty is
22:47
the new normal. Above all, stay
22:50
informed. Global finance is changing
22:53
faster than most people realize.
22:55
Information is no longer optional. In a
22:59
world where money itself is being
23:00
redesigned, ignorance is expensive, many
23:04
people think they are safe because their
23:06
accounts are denominated in dollars. But
23:09
safety comes from understanding, not
23:11
labels. A strong currency can lose value
23:14
if trust declines. A new system can gain
23:18
strength if confidence grows. That
23:20
dynamic has repeated for centuries. When
23:23
I see the bricks initiative, I do not
23:27
see rebellion. I see evolution, a
23:30
natural correction in a world that
23:33
became too dependent on one system. They
23:36
are building balance. The United States
23:38
still has every opportunity to lead
23:40
within this balance. But leadership now
23:44
means cooperation. It means
23:47
understanding that dominance and trust
23:49
are not the same. Dominance can be
23:51
imposed. Trust must be earned. If the
23:55
bricks experiment succeeds, it will mark
23:58
the return of resource back trade. That
24:02
does not mean a return to the past. It
24:05
means using modern technology to restore
24:07
a timeless principle. Value must be
24:10
backed by something real. Digital
24:12
networks, transparent ledgers, and
24:16
commodity anchors could define the next
24:19
era. If designed well, they could make
24:21
trade more stable and fairer. But if
24:24
designed poorly, they could fragment the
24:27
global economy. The outcome depends on
24:30
governance. Gold over $4,000
24:34
an ounce tells a story, not only about
24:38
inflation or speculation, but about
24:40
psychology.
24:41
When people lose faith in promises, they
24:44
reach for permanence. Gold, land,
24:48
commodities. These are forms of memory.
24:51
They hold value when trust forgets. I
24:54
remember a period in the 1980s when the
24:57
dollar was under pressure and investors
24:59
feared the same outcome. The US rebuilt
25:02
confidence through sound policy and
25:04
credibility. It can do so again. But
25:08
discipline must come before decline
25:10
becomes irreversible. If you think this
25:12
shift will happen overnight, it will
25:14
not. But if you think it will never
25:17
happen, you are ignoring history. The
25:20
signs are visible. Global reserves
25:23
diversifying commodity based exchanges
25:27
forming. New payment rails emerging
25:30
outside Swift. Uh each is a signal that
25:34
the financial map is being redrawn. In
25:37
practical terms, this means you should
25:39
prepare for more volatility in
25:41
currencies, commodities, and interest
25:43
rates. Periods of adjustment bring both
25:47
risk and opportunity.
25:49
Those who understand the transition can
25:51
protect and even grow their wealth.
25:54
Those who ignore it often wake up too
25:56
late. The Bricks Alliance has chosen to
26:00
anchor their money in reality. That
26:03
decision will not be reversed easily
26:06
because once a group learns to trade
26:08
without depending on another's currency,
26:11
it rarely returns to dependence. What
26:14
does this mean for investors in the
26:16
United States? It means the dollar's
26:19
value will be increasingly influenced by
26:21
perception, not policy alone. It means
26:25
gold and other tangible assets will
26:28
likely play a bigger role in portfolios.
26:32
It means the world will judge use
26:34
credibility by its actions, not its
26:37
history. I often remind people that
26:39
financial orders do not end in collapse.
26:41
They end in transition. The British
26:44
pound still exists. It simply stopped
26:47
being the center. The same could happen
26:50
to the dollar over decades, not days.
26:53
That is not a tragedy. It is a rotation.
26:57
For individuals, the response should be
27:00
patience and adaptability. The goal is
27:03
not to predict every move, but to
27:05
understand the direction of change and
27:08
the direction is cleared toward a system
27:11
where trust is diversified and value is
27:15
more tangible. Every major shift begins
27:18
with disbelief, then resistance, then
27:22
acceptance. Eventually, what once felt
27:25
unthinkable becomes normal. That is how
27:28
monetary history progresses. The bricks
27:31
announcement marks the disbelief stage.
27:33
Many will laugh at it. Some will dismiss
27:36
it as symbolic, but symbols matter
27:39
because they signal intention and
27:42
intention shaped systems. As this story
27:45
unfolds, stay grounded in fundamentals.
27:48
Debt, productivity, trust. Those are the
27:52
levers of long-term stability. Watch
27:55
them more closely than headlines. We are
27:58
living through one of those rare turning
28:00
points when the rules of money are
28:02
rewritten. It will not feel dramatic at
28:05
first, but decades from now, people will
28:08
study this period the way we study the
28:10
1940s or 1970s. They will see how
28:13
quietly everything began to shift. I
28:16
have spent my life analyzing cycles. and
28:20
one lesson repeats. Every rise carries
28:24
the seed of its decline and every
28:26
decline carries the seed of renewal. The
28:29
challenge is to see it early enough to
28:32
adapt. The brick's currency plan is not
28:35
a random headline. It is the blueprint
28:38
of a new order taking shape beneath the
28:40
surface. Whether it succeeds or fails,
28:43
the attempt itself changes expectations.
28:47
And once expectations change, history
28:50
begins to move. So remember this moment,
28:53
not because gold hit $4,000.
28:56
Not because leaders argued about
28:58
tariffs, but because for the first time
29:01
in a century, the foundation of global
29:04
money was questioned by half the world.
29:07
That is how cycles turn. Slowly, then
29:11
suddenly. Stay thoughtful. Stay
29:14
observant. Because the next chapter of
29:17
this story will decide how value is
29:19
defined for the rest of your life.
