Chapter 8, the overall big cycle.
0:05
If I had to pick the most important chapter in this book, this would be it. That's because it deals with the biggest
0:12
and most important forces that are dramatically changing the world order.
0:17
And it shows how and why these forces have repeatedly driven history through
0:23
its big cycles. Having seen so many of these big cycles, watching what is
0:28
happening now is like watching a movie that I've seen many times before, just a
0:34
contemporary version in which the clothes that the people are wearing and the technologies that they are using are
0:41
more modern. I hope to show you what I see. Also by showing what happened in
0:47
the past and why it happened, we can understand how previously unimaginable
0:54
developments are now happening and could happen in the future.
1:00
While this book is mostly focused on understanding what's going on with the
1:05
debt, credit, money, economic cycles, we can't look at this dynamic in isolation
1:12
and make sense of it because how these cycles transpire is influenced by other
1:19
big forces. Similarly to understand what is happening in other areas we need to
1:25
understand the debt, credit, money and economic force as it has big effects on
1:31
the developments of most areas. Together five big forces produce the overall big
1:39
cycle that leads to radical changes in monetary, domestic andor world orders. I
1:48
comprehensively explained how this overall big cycle works and how it was
1:53
manifest over the last 500 years in my book principles for dealing with the
1:59
changing world order. But I won't cram that 600page book in here. Instead, I'm
2:05
going to give you a very brief summary. That way when we turn to part three
2:10
about what has happened in our current big cycle and part four in which I will
2:16
try to look into the future, you will be able to see how what actually happened
2:22
compares with my templates of both the big debt cycle and the overall big
2:29
cycle. how the machine works.
How the machine works
2:35
Because everything that happens has reasons that make it happen, it appears to me that everything changes like a
2:42
perpetual motion machine. To understand this machine, one needs to understand
2:48
its mechanics. Because everything affects everything else directly or indirectly, these
2:56
mechanics are very complex. Sometimes I try to explain what I know
3:01
about them with enough of their complexity to show them in useful detail
3:07
such as I did previously in this book to explain how countries go broke. And
3:13
sometimes I try to explain them simply. As the saying goes, any fool can make
3:18
something complicated. It takes a genius to make it simple. In this chapter, I
3:25
will try to explain the big cycle simply. I will begin by explaining my
3:31
approach. As a global macro investor for most of my life, I've tried to understand and
3:38
model the cause effect relationships and use my models to bet on what will happen
3:44
in the markets. To do that, for about the last 35 years, I've created
3:50
computerized expert systems that enable the computer to make decisions like I
3:56
make them. These systems are based on the following principle.
4:02
Decisionmaking systems should be based on timeless and universal relationships.
4:07
Meaning that they should explain all the big important developments in all time
4:15
frames and in all countries though not necessarily precisely or in detail. If
4:22
they fail to explain all the big developments in all time frames and in
4:27
all countries, that indicates that an important influence is missing and needs
4:34
to be added to the template or model that we're using. The expert systems
4:40
I've built are previously developed forms of artificial intelligence.
4:46
Now with various breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, I am and I
4:51
believe we all are on the brink of being able to understand all of the cause
4:58
effect relationships that drive everything. Though for now, we still
5:03
have to labor along the old-fashioned way with people studying what happened
5:08
using computing and AI tools that are available.
5:14
That is why in my own feeble attempts to understand and describe the most
5:19
important mechanics that change the world as we know it, I do these indepth
5:24
studies and create explanations of them. What I'm about to describe is a result
5:31
of this process. However, because the forces that drive the big cycle are so big, it is easy to
5:39
see and understand them without worrying about the details and the complexities.
5:45
Zooming out to the highest level, the five most important drivers of change
5:50
are one, the debt, credit, money, economic
5:56
cycle. Two, the internal order and disorder
6:02
cycle. Three, the external geopolitical
6:07
order and disorder cycle. In other words, the changing whole world order.
6:13
four, acts of nature, in other words, droughts, floods, and pandemics.
6:19
And five, human inventiveness, most importantly, of new technologies.
6:27
These forces affect each other to shape the biggest things that happen, creating
6:32
cycles that move markets and economies around an upward sloping trend line.
6:39
The incline of this upward slope is primarily driven by the inventiveness of
6:46
practical people. In other words, entrepreneurs who are given adequate resources, in other words, capital and
6:53
work well with others, co-workers, government officials, lawyers, etc. to
6:59
make the inventions and products that create productivity improvements
7:06
over a shorter period of time. 1 to 10 years. The shortterm cycles, especially
7:12
the debt and political cycles are dominant. Over a long period of time, 10 years and
7:19
beyond, the long-term cycles and the upward sloping trend in productivity
7:25
have much bigger effects. I will now delve into these five forces.
7:31
While hearing about them, please think about how these forces have worked and how they are working now.
7:38
that will help you see how and why history rhymes and better understand
7:45
what is happening now and what is likely to happen.
How the overall big cycle works
7:51
How the overall big cycle works. The five big forces.
7:58
We are now 80 years into the overall big cycle that began at the end of World War
8:03
II, which is by and large unfolding in the classic ways that will produce
8:09
dramatic changes that one can only imagine by visualizing these five forces
8:17
interacting simultaneously in a historical context.
The debt credit money economic cycle
8:23
More specifically, one, the debt, credit, money economic
8:29
cycle. Throughout this book, I have described the most important things that influence
8:35
the big debt cycle like debt service payments relative to income, the amount
8:41
of new debt sold relative to the demand for it, the desiraability and
8:47
willingness of debt asset holders to hold their existing debt assets and
8:52
other factors explained earlier. Because I have already covered this big
8:58
debt cycle so completely that you're probably sick of hearing about it, I won't say much more. I will just
9:05
reiterate the main points I want to get across, which are there has always been,
9:12
and I expect that there always will be short-term cycles that over time add up
9:18
to big debt cycles. The average short-term debt cycle has
9:24
typically taken about six years, give or take about three, with the duration of
9:29
that cycle dependent on a number of influences that we can monitor and use
9:35
to come up with rough estimates of how long each one will last.
9:40
The average long-term debt cycle has typically taken around 80 years, give or
9:45
take about 25 years, with the duration of that cycle also driven by a number of
9:51
influences that we can monitor and used to come up with rough estimates of how
9:56
long each one will last. These debt cycles are influenced by and
10:03
influence other things. most importantly what I have identified as the four other
10:10
big forces. To summarize the dynamic in a few sentences, what has timelessly and
10:17
universally throughout the millennia and across countries driven the big debt
10:24
cycle changes and has created the big debt and economic problems is the
10:31
creation of unsustainably large amounts of debt assets and debt liabilities
10:37
relative to the amounts of money, goods, services, and investment. assets in
10:43
existence. This has always led to big debt crisis and runs on banks. By a run, I mean a
The big debt cycle
10:51
turning in of debt assets to banks in order to get real money which the bank
10:57
doesn't have enough of to meet the demand. Classically, when the holders of those financial assets actually try to
11:04
convert them back into money and buy things and see that they can't get the
11:10
buying power they believe they have stored in their dead assets, the run
11:16
accelerates and feeds on itself, which causes great shifts in market values and
11:21
wealth until debts are defaulted on, restructured, and/or monetized, reducing
11:28
the debt burdens relative relative to incomes and a new equilibrium is
11:33
reached. The debts are almost always monetized by which I mean that it is
11:38
almost always the case that the central bank creates a lot of money and credit to make it easier to pay back the debt
11:46
which devalues the money and the debt. It's worth noting that at times when the
11:52
debt money force, the internal order force and the external order force are
11:59
late in their cycles, in other words, when there is a lot of debt and a lot of
12:04
internal and external conflict. It is typically just before big conflicts and
12:11
revolutionary changes in monetary orders, internal orders, and world
12:17
orders. Like a life cycle, the big cycle goes through stages.
12:24
This late cycle stage, which I call stage 5, comes just before the depression and war stage that brings
12:30
about the end of the big cycle. For reasons I will explain later, I believe
12:36
that we are now in this late cycle stage. It is a time of radical,
12:42
typically unexpected changes that haven't happened in one's own lifetime,
12:48
but have happened many times throughout history. At such times, it is extremely
12:54
valuable to understand the past cases of big changes and consider whether they
13:00
could happen again. In my book, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order, I examined a number of such
13:07
cases. Since history can be an effective guide for understanding cause effect
13:13
relationships and bringing perspective on what is now happening and what might
13:18
happen. We can use these historical cases to think about what's logically
13:24
likely to happen under the existing circumstances. So what are these existing circumstances
13:32
at this time? There is great overindness in the United States and in all major countries at the same time as there are
13:40
increasingly nationalistic and fragmented internal orders in these
13:46
countries, increasingly contentious relationships between countries, adverse
13:53
and expensive acts of nature, and amazing new technologies.
13:59
Looking at past cases with similar configurations of conditions can help us
14:04
imagine otherwise unimaginable possible developments.
14:10
For example, I repeatedly saw and will show you in the next part of the book that when faced with similar conditions
14:17
of excessive debt, countries including the United States took the following
14:22
extraordinary actions. exerting great pressure on countries to
14:28
buy the country's debt as the British did in the past, selectively freezing
14:34
debt and/or taking the assets of enemy countries the way the US did to Japan
14:41
and Russia more recently. Defaulting on and restructuring debts by
14:47
extending maturities or monetizing them to cut debt burdens the way Germany did
14:53
after Hitler came to power. imposing confiscatory taxes and capital
14:59
or foreign exchange controls to prevent assets from leaving the country,
15:04
revaluing government assets and creating new types of money.
15:11
To be clear, I'm not saying these sort of things will happen, and I am hesitant to raise them as possibilities because
15:18
my doing so could engender exaggerated fears which could prompt inappropriate
15:24
and exaggerated actions. However, like a good doctor speaking to a patient
15:30
suffering from a serious disease, I feel that it would be an irresponsible
15:35
omission of mine not to convey what past cases tell us about the possibilities
15:42
that sometimes accompany these conditions. Number two, the second big force, the
The second big cycle
15:50
internal order and disorder cycle. Within countries, there are both
15:56
short-term political swings lasting about 6 years on average, give or take 3
16:02
years, that over time add up to big shifts in domestic orders that last
16:08
about 80 years, give or take about 25 years. To reiterate, I don't mean that
16:14
these time frames are fixed because they are highly variable in duration, but I
16:21
do mean that they have always happened and I believe they always will happen
16:26
with the durations driven by influences that we can monitor and use to come up
16:32
with rough estimates of how long each one will last. These are the cycles that
16:38
exist within countries and lead to conflicts and changes in the system of
16:43
governance or what I am calling orders. These fights for power work basically
16:50
the same way in all systems of government, all types of organizations
16:55
and even within families because the approaches to fighting them are embedded
17:01
in human nature. So how do they work? It's simple. Nothing lasts forever. That
How do they work
17:09
includes the orders built around established leaders and governance
17:14
system. Changes in orders are driven by those who have the greatest power
17:20
getting to determine what is done. Orders change when those who don't run
17:25
the existing order acquire more power than those who do and want to change it.
17:32
Fights occur when both a a powerful group wants to change the order and b it
17:40
is not clear which side has more power so only a fight can determine it. Fights
17:47
don't occur if A there isn't a powerful group that wants to change the order and
17:53
or B there is a powerful group that wants to change it and it is so much
18:00
stronger than the existing group that the changes will take place with little
18:05
or no fighting. In democracies, there is an election cycle that roughly coincides with the
18:12
economic cycle because bad economic conditions typically lead to political
Election cycles
18:18
changes. At the beginning of a new popularly
18:23
chosen leader coming to power, for example, in the first 100 days of a new
18:29
presidency, there is a honeymoon period and great optimism. That is when dreams
18:36
of great changes and great improvements exist and before realities and
18:41
criticisms of how the new leader has shaped and handled them sets in. As time
18:47
passes, typically the big promises the leader made to get elected become
18:52
difficult to deliver and bad things happen. So disappointment sets in,
18:58
critics and enemies become bolder and support waines.
19:03
All this makes fighting to stay in power harder, which often leads to more
19:09
extreme actions to make that happen. These dynamics are at play in the United
19:15
States at my writing of this book in March 2025.
19:21
How things go typically depends mostly on the economy, which depends mostly on
19:27
where the market and economy shaping short-term and long-term debt, credit,
19:33
money, economic cycles are. Though exogenous events like droughts, floods,
19:40
pandemics, and big international or domestic conflicts can also matter.
19:46
All governance orders within countries change from one type to another from democracies to autocracies and from
19:54
autocracies to democracies and each type of order comes in varying flavors with
20:01
some managed well and some managed poorly. I will now focus on what happens
20:06
when democracies fail. When democracies fail, autocracies come
When democracies fail
20:13
in. In my studies of how orders have changed throughout history, I have seen how
20:19
changes from republicstyle representative democracies to
20:24
autocracies typically happen. These changes are exemplified in how Julius
20:30
Caesar in ancient Rome, Napoleon Bonapart in France, Benito Mussolini in
20:36
Italy, Adolf Hitler in Germany, a consortium of leaders in Japan,
20:43
Francisco Franco in Spain, Recept Erdogan in Turkey, and many other
20:50
countries leaders have shifted to become autocratic leaders. I also read about it
20:55
in Plato's Republic written about 375 B.CEE which is still a valuable
21:03
description of how democracies become autocracies.
21:08
In almost all cases there are large gaps in wealth and values, bad and worsening
21:15
conditions and weak fragmented leadership in the republicstyle
21:20
representative democracies. These democracies can't fix problems
21:26
because democracies intrinsically rely on compromise between opposing factions
21:32
and compromise breaks down during such times. So instead of following the laws
21:39
and the system of compromise, the opposing sides become willing to fight to win at all costs. Typically, this
21:47
leads to intensifying populist conflicts between those of the hard right and
21:53
those of the weak middle and those of the hard left. Conflicts increase,
21:59
especially during times of economic stress, which leads to fights for the power to control.
22:06
How these fights for power take place are largely similar for logical reasons
22:11
that I will explain. Plato pointed out and my study of history showed me that
22:17
leaders in democracies typically appeal to their constituents desire for
22:22
immediate benefits and temporary relief rather than doing the hard things that
22:28
address deeper systemic issues and make their nation strong over the long term.
22:35
I have seen and read historical accounts of how leadership also typically becomes
22:41
weak, decadent, and corrupt, especially after periods of great prosperity and
22:47
few challenges. Plato argued that when democracies become weak and decadent, they lose
22:53
sight of justice and virtue. They pass their peaks and begin their declines.
23:00
These periods are typically marked by growing corruption, inequality, and a
23:05
failure of institutions to function effectively. When the system no longer
23:11
satisfies the needs of a large percentage of the people, it loses legitimacy
23:17
independently. And long before Plato observed this, this dynamic was
23:23
recognized in China where it is called losing the mandate of heaven. It is when
23:30
and why orders fail. In times of disorder, financial,
demagogues
23:36
political, and military power matters more than laws, and authoritarianism
23:44
works better than weak, disorganized collectivism. Plato called the person who typically
23:51
leads the revolutionary changes from democracy to autocracies a demagogue.
23:57
Demagogues manipulate public opinion, stir up emotions, and use extraordinary
24:03
means to gain power. They typically rile up populist sentiment, promise easy
24:10
solutions to complex problems, and use propaganda and bullying to gain an
24:16
increase in power. They are generally of the well-educated class and gather
24:22
around them others who are powerful. When they are of the political hard right, they and those who support them
24:30
are typically rich and powerful nobles in the old days or capitalists since the
24:36
industrial revolution who are allied in the belief and their self-interest that
24:43
great leadership requires strong leadership and strong partnerships at
24:49
the top. Like strong companies that have to work well together to do great
24:54
things. When demagogues are of the left, they typically get their support from the
25:00
unprivileged masses. As these populist leaders, whether they are from the right
25:06
or the left, gain power, they typically employ tactics such as propaganda,
25:13
coercion, and the consolidation of power to undermine their enemies and the
25:19
democratic institutions that support their enemies and/or that support the
25:24
inefficient bureaucracies that are enabling the problems rather than fixing
25:30
them. This typically leads to the eventual replacement of democracy with a
25:36
more centralized dictatorial form of government. The approach a strong CEO uses in
25:43
running a company can be difficult to distinguish from a demagogue's approach.
25:49
In fact, it can be said that some strong CEOs govern as demagogues. So, it should
25:54
be expected that if they were running governments, they would run them the same way. In both cases, there are
26:01
people who take control and make radical changes to make radical improvements.
26:07
And the big questions are what will the controls on them be? And how far will
26:14
they take the autocracy? If looking at a company, one should see if there is strong oversight and a
26:21
controlling force like a board and controls from effective regulators.
26:27
For governments, such controls come from oversight functions and separation of
26:34
powers. The more uncontrolled they are, the more dictatorial the leaders are
26:40
likely to become. A relevant good principle is
power corrupts
26:46
power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely
26:51
which is a phrase attributed to historian and politician Lord Actton in 1887.
26:58
In the new order that emerges financial and political power matters more than
27:04
laws and authoritarianism works better than weak disorganized
27:10
collectivism. In most of these cases, the transfers from the democracies to the autocracies
27:17
takes place within the rules of democracy and become increasingly
27:23
extreme over a few years, usually over about 3 to 5 years. These leaders
27:29
typically make radical changes to the monetary, political and geopolitical
27:35
orders and they typically become very nationalistic, militaristic, expansionist and
27:43
autocratic. As mentioned, examples include Caesar in Rome, Napoleon in France, Hitler in
27:50
Germany, and Mussolini in Italy in ways that were more thoroughly explained in
27:56
principles for dealing with the changing world order. And that should be apparent to observers who are watching what is
28:03
happening today. This is now taking place with big political shifts mostly toward the hard
28:10
right for the same reasons that they happened in the past.
28:17
Number three, the third big force, the international order and disorder cycle.
28:24
In other words, the changing world order. How countries deal with each other is of
28:31
paramount importance and it too is cyclical for the same reason that there are
28:38
periods of order. In other words, periods of harmony, productivity and prosperity
28:44
and there are periods of disorder. In other words, periods of great conflict, destruction and depression. And there
28:52
are big cyclical swings between these periods within countries. There are
28:57
periods of order. In other words, harmony, productivity and prosperity and
29:03
there are periods of disorder, periods of great conflict, destruction and depression between countries.
29:10
The periods of disorder take place when there are fights to determine which country or which countries will have the
29:19
power to set what type of order exists. However, because there has never been an
29:25
effective global governance system, the world order is more prone to disorder
29:32
and conflict. As part of the big cycle, there have also been big swings between
29:39
unilateralism in which there is fighting for one's self-interest, the strong winning over
29:45
the weak, and the law of the jungle and survival of the fittest. and
29:51
multilateralism, which is there is a striving for global
29:56
harmony, peaceful coexistence, and egalitarianism.
30:01
Historically, the only times that multilateralism worked were after wars
30:07
when people were sick of fighting and there was a dominant power to enforce how things should go.
30:14
In fact, throughout most of history, brutal, destructive unilateralism was
30:20
the norm. And periods in which there was multilateralism in pursuit of harmony, peaceful
30:27
coexistence, and the common good, were extremely rare and never sustained.
30:33
Consider that it wasn't until 1648 after the 30 years war that there was an
30:40
agreement in Europe called the peace of Westia that established that countries
30:47
have borders and that all countries would pledge to enforce those borders
30:53
rather than to simply fight one another to get what the other had, which up
30:58
until that point was the norm. Also consider that it wasn't until after
31:04
World War I when Woodro Wilson, the idealistic academic president of
31:10
Princeton University, who became president of the newly powerful the
31:15
United States in 1913, naively aspired to have a world
31:21
governance system that imitated the United States government system, the
31:27
League of Nations. It didn't last and it failed to prevent World War II which was
31:33
followed by the new American world order which created multilateral organizations
31:39
like the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the World Trade
31:45
Organization, the International Court of Justice, the World Intellectual Property
31:50
Organization and so on. These organizations aimed to foster global
31:56
cooperation, economic stability, and collective problem solving. The United
32:02
States, leveraging its unparalleled economic and military power, became the
32:08
lynchpin of this liberal international order, promoting democracy, free
32:15
markets, and human rights. While not without its flaws, this system
32:20
maintained a relative stability that has so far prevented another world war.
32:27
While we have all lived through a time when multilateralism's striving for harmony, peaceful
32:34
coexistence, and ealitarianism was of course what we all wanted.
32:41
Multilateralism is now fading into irrelevance and unilateralism is rising
32:48
for reasons that are understandable in the context of history. As a result, the
32:54
powers of multilateral organizations are declining rapidly and transitioning into
33:00
the hands of the major powers. I believe that the realists must accept the fact
33:06
that both the aspiration for and the existence of global cooperation are
33:12
eroding as the pendulum is swinging toward self-interested
33:18
unilateralism and survival of the fittest. It increasingly becomes the
33:24
case that the strong prey on the weak. These
33:29
developments are all typical of the stage of the big cycle that we're now in. While this transition from
33:36
multilateralism to unilateralism is at first shocking, it quickly becomes
33:42
normalized. For example, it was only months before this writing that Donald Trump's
33:48
statements concerning Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal would have been
33:53
considered unimaginable. At such times, alliances often change fast as
lessons from history
34:01
circumstances change quickly, and winning is more important than loyalties.
34:08
To help us imagine the future, we should pay close attention to the lessons from history. Through most of history,
34:15
without the existence of countries with viable borders, collections of people
34:21
with common interests fought to seize wealth from others with common interests
34:27
or to defend their own interests. Those who won got richer and more civilized.
34:34
They typically got more decadent and weaker and eventually were taken down by
34:41
stronger barbarians who were in turn brought down by subsequent generations
34:47
learning to be stronger. For example, that is the story of the rise of the amazing Roman Empire and then its defeat
34:56
by the Gauls as well as the rises and falls of most dynasties and with them
35:02
the rises and declines of leadership approaches. These alternating ages of barbarianism
35:10
and civility contributed to periods of war that took down the more advanced
35:17
civilizations when barbarians were stronger and civilizations were weak.
acts of nature
35:24
History has repeatedly shown us that civility when taken too far creates weak
35:30
decadence that eventually loses to strong barbarianism.
35:36
The peaceful and productive modern-day version of this is the fighting that
35:41
happens in business with the invention of new and effective business ideas and
35:47
weapons that fuel creative destruction. We love to watch these fights which are
35:54
like watching fights in the Roman coliseum. Or better yet, we love being
35:59
in them. Frankly, I love being in them and I detest impractical idealism
36:07
while I love practical idealism above all else. But when taken too far, the
36:14
destructive version of the same impulse leads to a lack of cooperation and to
36:20
fighting in politics, geopolitics, dealing with acts of nature and new
36:26
technologies that can be very destructive. So I worry about that.
36:34
Number four, the fourth big force, acts of nature, droughts, floods, and
36:41
pandemics. Throughout history, acts of nature have killed more people than wars and toppled
36:48
more orders than the previously mentioned forces. And an objective view
36:53
of the data shows that droughts, floods, and pandemics are increasing and
36:59
increasingly costly. While why this is happening is debated,
37:05
that it is happening is not debatable. Nor is it debatable that humanity's
37:11
polluting and disrupting of nature, higher human population density, closer
37:17
contact across the world brought about by more international travel, and closer
37:23
contact with other species due to land development leading to animal human
37:30
disease transmissions are all causes. We regularly see these happening in the
37:36
news, most recently with the Los Angeles wildfires. It is almost certain that these problems
37:43
will get worse. As with other forces, this force is intertwined with the other big forces to
37:50
shape what's happening. For example, the migration issues in developed countries
37:57
with migration pressures resulting from changes in climate and the living
38:02
condition issues in underdeveloped countries where people are struggling to
38:08
adapt to droughts, floods, and other changes are obviously worsening due to
38:13
damaging acts of nature increasing. And given that nearly all nations are facing
38:19
debt and money issues, there isn't enough money to be spent on climate
38:24
mitigation or adaptation. Number five, the fifth force, human
38:33
inventiveness, most importantly of new technologies.
38:39
There are great advances in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence,
38:46
that will dramatically affect all thinking in all areas for good or bad.
38:52
Throughout history, technological advances have raised living standards and life expecties and have been used to
39:00
generate economic and military power and have been used in wars to create great
39:05
destructions. They are closely tied to the other four forces. When
39:11
technological advances are supported by good financial, economic and social
39:16
conditions, they advance more quickly than when those conditions are bad. But
39:22
when their developments are supported by unsustainable credit growth, they tend
39:28
to cause financial bubbles and busts. For example, the South Sea bubble in
39:34
1720 when the Dutch Empire was beginning to decline, the railway mania in the
39:41
1830s and 1840s, the electricity and utilities bubbles in
39:48
the 1870s and 1890s, and the dotcom bubble and telecom's crash from 1990 to
39:56
2001 are all relevant examples of cases where trade advances and improving
40:03
technologies led to debt bubbles and busts as well as the beneficial changes
40:10
they produced. That's enough of the overall big cycle for now. Enough to help you better
40:17
understand the dynamics you'll hear about in part three as you look at the events that have unfolded since our
40:25
current big cycle began in 1945 with the end of World War II.
40:31
It will also help you understand the perspective I take when I attempt to look into the future in part four. But
40:40
before we move on, it is worth sharing one final principle which is about the
40:47
biggest impact of how the challenges that arise during the big cycle are
40:53
handled. Namely, the biggest and most important force is
final principle
41:00
how people deal with each other. If people deal with their problems and
41:05
their opportunities together rather than fight each other, they can get the best
41:11
possible results. Unfortunately, while technology has evolved a lot, human nature hasn't
41:19
changed much. So this is still probably beyond the capabilities of humankind.
41:26
We will see.
