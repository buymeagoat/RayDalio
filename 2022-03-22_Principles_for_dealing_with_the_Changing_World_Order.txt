(dramatic music) - [Ray Dalio] The changing world order.
0:06
The times ahead will be radically different from those that we've experienced in our lifetimes,
0:12
though similar to many times before. How do I know that? Because they always have been.
0:23
Over my roughly 50 years of global macroeconomic investing,
0:29
I've learned the hard way that the most important events that surprised me,
0:34
did so because they never happened in my lifetime. These painful surprises led me to study
0:41
the last 500 years of history for similar situations where I saw that they had indeed happened many times before
0:50
with the ups and the downs of the Dutch,
0:55
British, and US empires.
1:03
And every time they did, it was a sign of the changing world order.
1:11
This study taught me valuable lessons that I'm going to pass along to you here in a distilled form.
1:18
You can find the comprehensive version in my book, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order.
1:26
Let me begin with a story that brought me to this point, about how I learned to anticipate the future
1:32
by studying the past.
1:47
In 1971, when I was a young clerk on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange,
1:52
the United States ran out of money and defaulted on its debts. That's right. The US ran out of money.
2:00
How? Well, back then gold was the money used in transactions between countries.
2:07
Paper money, like the dollar, was like checks in a checkbook in that it had no value
2:13
other than it could be exchanged for gold, which was the real money. At the time, the United States was spending
2:20
a lot more money than it was earning by writing a lot more of these paper money checks
2:26
than it had gold in the bank to exchange for them. As people turned these checks into the bank for gold money,
2:33
the amount of gold in the US started to dwindle. It soon became obvious
2:38
that the US couldn't keep its promises for all the existing paper money, so people holding dollars rushed to exchange them
2:47
before the gold ran out. Recognizing that the US was going to run out of real money,
2:53
on Sunday evening, August 15th, President Nixon went on television to tell the world
2:59
that the US was breaking its promise to let people exchange their dollars for gold.
3:05
Of course, he didn't say it that way. He said it more diplomatically, without making it clear
3:10
that the United States was defaulting. - [President Nixon] The strength of a nation's currency is based on the strength of that nation's economy.
3:17
And the American economy is by far the strongest in the world. Accordingly, I have directed the secretary of the treasury
3:25
to take the action necessary to defend the dollar against the speculators.
3:31
I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold
3:36
or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability
3:43
and in the best interest of the United States. - [Ray] I watched in awe realizing that money as we understood it was ending.
3:53
What a crisis! I expected the stock market to plunge the next day,
3:59
so I got on the exchange floor early to prepare. When the opening bell rang, pandemonium broke out,
4:06
but not the kind I expected. The market was up - way up -
4:13
and went on to rise nearly 25%. That surprised me
4:18
because I never experienced a currency devaluation before.
4:23
When I dug into history, I discovered that the exact same thing happened in 1933
4:30
and had the exact same effect. Then, paper dollars were also linked to gold,
4:35
which the US was running out of because it was spending more paper money checks
4:41
than it had gold to exchange for them. And President Roosevelt announced on the radio
4:47
that he would break the country's promise to exchange dollars for gold. - [President Roosevelt] It was then that I issued the
4:55
proclamation providing for the national bank holiday. And this was the first step in the government's reconstruction
5:01
of our financial and economic fabrics. The second step, last Thursday, was the legislation
5:09
promptly and patriotically passed by the Congress confirming my proclamation and broadening my powers
5:17
so that it became possible in view of the requirement of time to extend the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday
5:25
gradually in the days to come. This law also gave authority to develop a program...
5:32
- [Ray] In both cases, breaking the link to gold allowed the US to continue spending more than it earned
5:39
simply by printing more paper dollars. Since there was an increase in the number of dollars
5:45
without an increase in the country's wealth, the value of each dollar fell.
5:52
As these new dollars entered the market without a corresponding increase in productivity,
5:58
they went to buy lots of stocks, gold and commodities, and hence caused their prices to rise.
6:06
As I studied more history, I saw that the exact same thing happened many, many times before.
6:14
I saw that since the beginning of time, when governments spent much more than they took in taxes
6:21
and conditions got bad, they ran out of money and they needed more.
6:27
So, they printed more, a lot more, which made its value fall
6:33
and made the prices of most everything, including stocks, gold and commodities rise.
6:41
That's when I first learned the principle that when central banks print a lot of money to relieve a crisis,
6:47
buy stocks, gold and commodities because their value will rise
6:53
and the value of paper money will fall. This printing of money is also what happened in 2008
6:59
to relieve the mortgage-driven debt crisis, and in 2020 to relieve the pandemic-driven economic crisis.
7:08
And it almost certainly will happen in the future. So, I suggest that you keep this principle in mind.
7:16
These experiences gave me another principle, which is, to understand what is coming at you,
7:22
you need to understand what happened before you. That principle led me to study
7:28
how the roaring twenties bubble turned into the 1930s depression,
7:34
which gave me the lessons that allowed me to anticipate and profit from the 2007 bubble
7:42
turning into the 2008 bust.
7:47
All these experiences led me to develop an almost instinctual urge
7:52
to look to the past for similar situations to learn how to handle the future well.
7:59
Changing orders. (man whistles)
8:05
(machine beeping)
8:15
Over the last few years, three big things that hadn't happened in my lifetime prompted me to do this study.
8:22
First, countries didn't have enough money to pay their debts, even after lowering interest rates to zero.
8:30
So their central banks began printing lots of money to do so. Second, big internal conflicts emerged
8:38
due to growing gaps in wealth and values. This showed up in political populism
8:44
and polarization between the left, who want to redistribute wealth, and the right, who want to defend those holding the wealth.
8:52
And third, increasing external conflict between a rising great power and the leading great power,
8:59
as is now happening with China and the United States. So, I looked back.
9:05
I saw that all these had happened together before many times and nearly always led to changing domestic and world orders.
9:15
The last time this sequence happened was from 1930 to 1945.
9:22
What exactly is an order? You might ask. It's a governing system for people dealing with each other.
9:29
There are internal orders for governing within countries, typically laid out in constitutions.
9:36
And there is a world order for governing between countries, typically laid out in treaties.
9:42
Internal orders change at different times than world orders, though whether within or between countries,
9:49
these orders typically change after wars. Civil wars within countries,
9:57
international wars between countries. They happen when revolutionary new forces
10:03
defeat weak old orders. For example, the US internal order
10:08
was laid out in the constitution in 1789 after the American Revolution,
10:14
and it is still operating today, even after the American Civil War. Russia got rid of its old order and established a new one
10:23
with the Russian revolution in 1917, which ended in 1991 with a relatively bloodless revolution.
10:31
China began its current internal order in 1949 when the Chinese Communist Party won the civil war.
10:39
You get the idea. The current world order commonly called the American world order,
10:45
formed after the allied victory in World War II when the US emerged as the dominant world power.
10:53
It was set out in agreements and treaties for how global governance and monetary systems work.
10:59
In 1944, the new world monetary system was laid out in the Bretton Woods Agreement
11:06
and established the dollar as the world's leading reserve currency.
11:12
A reserve currency is a currency that is commonly accepted around the world,
11:17
and having one is a key factor in a country becoming the richest and most powerful empire.
11:25
With a new dominant power and monetary system established, a new world order begins.
11:32
These changes take place in a timeless and universal cycle that I call the big cycle.
11:41
I'll start with a quick overview, then give you a more complete version
11:47
and then direct you to my book if you want more. As I studied the 10 most powerful empires
11:55
over the last 500 years and the last three reserve currencies,
12:00
it took me through the rise and decline of the Dutch empire and the guilder,
12:05
the British empire and the pound, the rise and early decline in the United States empire and the dollar,
12:13
and the decline and rise of the Chinese empire and its currencies, as well as the rise and decline of the Spanish, German,
12:22
French, Indian, Japanese, Russian, and Ottoman empires,
12:28
along with their significant conflicts as measured in this chart.
12:34
To understand China's patterns better, I also studied the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties and their monies back to the year 600.
12:44
Because looking at all these measures at once can be confusing, I'll focus on the four most important ones,
12:51
the Dutch, British, US and Chinese. You'll quickly notice the pattern.
12:59
Now let's simplify the form a bit. As you can see, they transpired in overlapping cycles
13:06
that lasted about 250 years with 10 to 20 year transition periods between them.
13:13
Typically, these two transitions have been periods of great conflict because leading powers don't decline without a fight.
13:21
So, how am I measuring an empire's power? In this study, I used eight metrics.
13:28
Each country's measure of total power is derived by averaging them together.
13:33
They are education, inventiveness and technology development,
13:39
competitiveness in global markets, economic output, share of world trade, military strength,
13:47
the power of their financial center for capital markets and the strength of their currency as a reserve currency.
13:55
Because these powers are measurable, we can see how strong each country is now, was in the past,
14:02
and whether they're rising or declining. By examining the sequences from many countries,
14:10
we can see how a typical cycle transpires. And because the wiggles can be confusing,
14:17
we can simplify it a bit to focus on the pattern of cause-effect relationships
14:23
that drive the rise and decline of a typical empire. As you can see, better education typically leads
14:31
to increased innovation and technology development, and with a lag, the establishment of the currency
14:39
as a reserve currency. You can also see that these forces then declined in a similar order,
14:46
reinforcing each other's decline. Let's now look at the typical sequence of events
14:51
going on inside a country that produces these rises and declines.
14:56
In a nutshell, the big cycle typically begins after a major conflict, often a war,
15:03
establishes the new leading power and the new world order. Because no one wants to challenge this power,
15:11
a period of peace and prosperity typically follows. As people get used to this peace and prosperity,
15:18
they increasingly bet on it continuing. They borrow money to do that,
15:23
which eventually leads to a financial bubble. The empire's share of trade grows.
15:28
And when most transactions are conducted in its currency, it becomes a reserve currency,
15:35
which leads to even more borrowing. At the same time, this increased prosperity
15:41
distributes wealth unevenly. So the wealth gap typically grows between the rich "haves" and the poor "have-nots".
15:50
Eventually, the financial bubble bursts, which leads to the printing of money,
15:56
an increased internal conflict between the rich and the poor, which leads to some form of revolution
16:03
to redistribute wealth. This can happen peacefully or as a civil war.
16:09
While the empire struggles with this internal conflict, its power diminishes relative to
16:15
external rival powers on the rise. When a new rising power gets strong enough to compete with the dominant power
16:23
that is having domestic breakdowns, external conflicts, most typically wars, take place.
16:31
Out of these internal and external wars come new winners and losers.
16:37
Then the winners get together to create the new world order. And the cycle begins again.
16:45
As I looked back, I saw that these cause and effect relationships drove the cycles of rises and declines
16:52
all the way back to the Roman empire. I saw how the stories of each one of these cycles
16:58
blended together with others before, during, and after in the same way as each individual story blends with others
17:08
to make the epic 500 year story that is our collective history.
17:14
And like human life cycles, no two are exactly the same, but most are similar.
17:20
They're driven by logical cause and effect relationships that progress through stages from birth
17:27
to strength and maturity to weakness and inevitably decline.
17:33
However, that's like saying a person's life cycle takes 80 years on average
17:38
without recognizing that many are much shorter and many are longer.
17:44
While age can be a good indicator of future longevity, a better way is to look at health indicators.
17:51
One can do that with empires and their vital signs too. I found that by watching the indicators of power change,
17:59
I was able to see what stage a country was in, which helped me to anticipate what was likely to come next.
18:07
Now, I'll take you through the big cycle in more detail. Give me 20 minutes
18:12
and I'll give you the last 500 years of history and show you the similar patterns across
18:18
the Dutch, British, US and Chinese empires.
18:25
500 years of big cycles.
18:30
(wind whooshing) I'm going to describe the typical cycle
18:37
by dividing it into three phases. The rise, the top, and the decline.
18:45
The rise. Successful new orders that rise, both internal and external,
18:52
are typically started by powerful revolutionary leaders doing four things.
18:58
First, they win power by gaining more support than the opposition. Second, they consolidate power
19:06
by converting, weakening, or eliminating the opposition so they don't stand in their way.
19:12
Third, they establish systems and institutions that make the country work well.
19:17
And fourth, they pick their successors well, or create systems that do that,
19:23
because a great empire requires many great leaders over several generations.
19:29
At this stage soon after winning the fight, there was typically a period of peace and growing prosperity
19:36
because the leadership is clearly dominant and has broad support so no one wants to fight it.
19:42
During this phase, leaders within the country have to design an excellent system
19:47
to raise the country's wealth and power. First and foremost, to be great they must have strong education,
19:55
which is not just teaching knowledge and skills, but also strong character, civility and work ethic.
20:03
These are typically taught in the family, schools and religious institutions. That provides a healthy respect for rules and laws,
20:11
order within society, low corruption, and enables them to unite behind a common purpose
20:18
and work well together. As they do this, they increasingly shift from producing basic products
20:25
to innovating and inventing new technologies.
20:31
For example, the Dutch rose to defeat the Habsburg empire and become superbly educated.
20:38
They became so inventive that they came up with a quarter of all major inventions in the world.
20:44
The most important of which was the invention of ships that could travel around the world to collect great riches
20:51
and the invention of capitalism as we know it today to finance those voyages.
20:57
They, like all leading empires, enhanced their thinking by being open to the best thinking in the world.
21:04
As a result, the people in the country become more productive and more competitive in world markets,
21:11
which shows up in their growing economic output and rising share of world trade.
21:19
You can see this happening now as the US and China are roughly comparable in both their economic outputs
21:26
and their shares of world trade. As countries trade more globally,
21:32
they must protect their trade routes and their foreign interests from attack. So they develop great military strength.
21:40
If done well, this virtuous cycle leads to strong income growth,
21:45
which can be used to finance investments in education, infrastructure, and research and development.
21:53
They must also develop systems to incentivize and empower those that have the ability to make or take wealth.
22:02
In all of these cases, the most successful empires used a capitalist approach
22:10
to develop productive entrepreneurs. Even China, which is run by the Chinese Communist Party,
22:17
used a form of this capitalist approach. (cash registers ringing)
22:27
Deng Xiaoping, when asked about this, said, "It doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a black cat,
22:33
"as long as it catches mice." And "it's glorious to be rich."
22:39
To do this well, they must develop their capital markets. Most importantly, their lending, bond and stock markets.
22:48
That allows people to convert their savings into investments, to fund invention and development
22:57
and share in the successes of those who make great things happen.
23:03
The Dutch created the first publicly listed company, the Dutch East India Company,
23:08
and the first stock market to fund it, which were integral parts of the system that produced massive wealth and power.
23:17
As a natural consequence, the greatest empires developed the world's leading financial centers
23:23
for attracting and distributing the world's capital. Amsterdam was the world's financial center
23:30
when the Dutch were preeminent, London when the British were on top,
23:35
New York is now, and China is quickly developing its financial centers.
23:41
Most importantly, the capitalists, the governments and the military must work together.
23:48
Not only did the Dutch work well together, they were one in the same. The Dutch East India Company
23:55
was granted a trade monopoly from the government and had its own officially sanctioned military
24:01
to go out into the global markets to make and take wealth.
24:07
The British followed with the British East India Company and had a similar coordination
24:12
of their government, business and military operations. The US Military Industrial Complex followed suit,
24:21
as does the Chinese system today.
24:26
As the country becomes the largest international trading empire, its transactions can be paid with its currency,
24:34
making it the preferred global medium of exchange, and because their currency
24:40
is so widely accepted and frequently used, people around the world want to save in it,
24:47
making it the preferred store hold of wealth. And thus the world's leading reserve currency.
24:55
The guilder was the world's main reserve currency when the Dutch led world trade.
25:00
The pound was when the British led. And the dollar has been since the US led.
25:07
Naturally, China's currency is increasingly being used as a reserve currency.
25:12
Having a reserve currency enables the empire to borrow more than other countries.
25:19
That advantage is huge. Think about it. People all over the world are eager to save
25:27
and hence lend back their currency to the empire. Countries without a reserve currency don't have that.
25:34
And when the empire runs out of its own money, remember the United States in 1971,
25:41
they can always print more. The exorbitant privilege afforded by the empire's reserve currency
25:48
leads borrowing to increase and the beginning of a financial bubble.
25:54
This series of cause and effect relationships, leading to mutually supportive
26:00
financial, political and military powers, bolstered by the borrowing power of a reserve currency,
26:06
have gone together since history began to be recorded. All the empires that became the most powerful in the world
26:14
followed this path to the top.
26:27
While in the top phase, most of these strengths are sustained, embedded within the fruits of their success
26:34
are the seeds of their decline. As a rule, as people in these rich and powerful countries earn more,
26:42
that makes them more expensive and less competitive relative to people in other countries
26:47
who are willing to work for less. At the same time, people in other countries naturally copy
26:54
the methods and technologies of the leading power, which further reduces the leading power's competitiveness.
27:01
For example, British ship builders had less expensive workers than Dutch ship builders.
27:08
So, they hired Dutch designers to design better ships that were built by less expensive British workers,
27:16
making them more competitive, which led the British to rise and the Dutch to decline.
27:22
Also, as people become richer, they tend not to work as hard. They enjoy more leisure,
27:28
pursue the finer and less productive things in life, and at the extreme, become decadent.
27:35
Values change from generation to generation during the rise to the top from those who had to fight to achieve wealth and power
27:43
to those who inherited it. (boy groans) (boy blows raspberry) They're less battle heartened, steeped in luxuries
27:49
and accustomed to the easy life, which makes them more vulnerable to challenges.
27:54
The golden era of the Dutch empire
28:00
(glasses clink) and the Victorian era of the British empire
28:08
(glasses clink) were such high prosperity periods like this.
28:15
As people get used to doing well, they increasingly bet on the good times continuing
28:21
and borrow money to do that, which grows into the financial bubbles.
28:27
Naturally, the financial gains come unevenly. So, the wealth gap grows.
28:33
Wealth gaps are self-reinforcing because rich people use their greater resources
28:38
to reinforce their powers. For example, they give greater privileges to their children,
28:44
like better education, and they influence the political system to their advantage.
28:50
This causes the gaps in values, politics, and opportunities to grow between
28:56
the rich "haves" and the poor "have-nots". Those who are less well-off feel the system is unfair,
29:04
so resentments grow. But as long as the living standards of most people are still rising,
29:10
these gaps in resentments don't boil over into conflict. Having the world's reserve currency
29:17
inevitably leads to borrowing excessively and contributes to the country building up
29:23
large debts with foreign lenders. While this boosts spending power over the short term,
29:29
it weakens the country's financial health and weakens the currency over the long-term.
29:36
In other words, when borrowing and spending are strong, the empire appears very strong,
29:42
but its finances are in fact being weakened. The borrowing sustains the country's power
29:49
beyond its fundamentals by financing both domestic over consumption
29:54
and international military conflicts required to maintain the empire.
30:00
Inevitably, the cost of maintaining and defending the empire becomes greater than the revenue it brings in.
30:06
So having an empire becomes unprofitable. For example, the Dutch empire overextended around the world
30:14
and fought war after increasingly expensive war with the British and other European powers
30:20
to protect its territory and trade routes. The British empire similarly became massive, bureaucratic,
30:26
and lost its competitive advantages as rival powers, particularly Germany, soared,
30:33
leading to an increasingly expensive arms race and world war.
30:39
The US has spent about eight trillion dollars on foreign wars and their consequences since September 11th,
30:47
and trillions more for other military operations and for supporting military bases in 70 countries,
30:55
and it still isn't spending enough to support its military competition with China in the area around China.
31:03
In this cycle, the richer countries eventually get deeper into debt by borrowing from poor countries that save more.
31:10
It's one of the early signs of a wealth and power shift. This started in the United States in the 1980s
31:16
when it had a per capita income 40 times that of China's, and started borrowing from Chinese
31:23
who wanted to save in dollars because the dollar was the world's reserve currency.
31:29
Similarly, the British borrowed a lot of money from its much poorer colonies
31:34
and the Dutch did the same at their top. If the empire begins to run out of new lenders,
31:40
those holding their currency begin to look to sell and get out rather than to buy, save, lend, and get in,
31:55
and the strength of the empire begins to decline. The decline.
32:02
The decline comes from internal economic weakness together with internal fighting
32:07
or costly external fighting or both. Typically, the decline comes gradually
32:14
and then very suddenly. When debts become very large, and there is an economic downturn,
32:22
and the empire can no longer borrow the money necessary to repay its debts,
32:27
the financial bubble bursts. This creates great domestic hardships
32:32
and forces the country to choose between defaulting on its debts or printing a lot of new money.
32:39
It always chooses to print a lot of new money. At first gradually, and eventually massively.
32:48
That devalues the currency and raises inflation. For the Dutch, this was the financial crisis
32:55
brought about by financial excesses and paying for the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War.
33:00
Similarly, for the British, it was paying for its financial excesses and its debts from the two world wars.
33:07
And for the US, it's been three cycles of debt, finance, booms, and busts since the nineties
33:14
with the central bank stepping in each time with stronger measures.
33:21
When the government has problems funding itself, when there are bad economic conditions
33:27
and living standards for most people are declining, and there are large wealth, values, and political gaps,
33:36
internal conflict between the rich and the poor, as well as different ethnic, religious, and racial groups
33:43
greatly increases. This leads to political extremism that shows up as populism of the left or the right.
33:52
Those of the left seek to redistribute the wealth while those of the right seek to maintain the wealth
33:57
in the hands of the rich. Typically during such times, taxes on the rich rise
34:03
and when the rich fear their wealth and wellbeing will be taken away, they move to places, assets, and currencies
34:11
they feel safer in. These outflows reduce the empire's tax revenue, which leads to a classic, self-reinforcing,
34:19
hollowing out process. When the flight of wealth gets bad enough,
34:24
governments outlaw it. Those seeking to get out begin to panic.
34:29
These turbulent conditions undermine productivity, which shrinks the economic pie and causes more conflict
34:36
about how to divide the shrinking resources. Populist leaders emerge from both sides
34:42
and pledge to take control and bring about order. That's when democracy is most challenged,
34:48
because it fails to control the anarchy, and it is when the move to a strong populist leader
34:53
who will bring order to the chaos is most likely. As conflict within the country escalates,
34:59
it leads to some form of revolution or civil war to redistribute wealth and force the necessary big changes.
35:08
This can be peaceful and maintain the existing order, but it's more often violent and changes the order.
35:18
For example, the Roosevelt revolution to redistribute wealth was relatively peaceful
35:23
and maintained the existing internal order, while the French revolution, the Russian revolution,
35:30
and the Chinese revolution were much more violent and led to new internal orders.
35:37
This internal conflict makes the empire weak and vulnerable to rising external rivals
35:44
who, seeing this domestic weakness, are more inclined to mount a challenge.
35:49
This raises the risk of great international conflict, especially if the rival has built up a comparable military.
35:57
Defending one's self and one's empire against rivals requires great military spending, which has to occur
36:05
as domestic economic conditions are deteriorating and the empire can least afford it.
36:11
Since there is no viable system for peacefully adjudicating international disputes,
36:16
these conflicts are typically resolved through tests of power.
36:22
As bolder challenges are made, the leading empire is faced with the difficult choice
36:27
of fighting or retreating. Fighting and losing is the worst outcome,
36:32
but retreating is bad too as it cedes progress to the rival and signals that the empire is weak
36:39
to those countries that are considering which side to be on. Poor economic conditions
36:44
cause more fighting for wealth and power, which inevitably leads to some kind of war.
36:51
Wars are terribly costly. At the same time, they produce the tectonic shifts
36:57
that realign the new orders to the new realities of wealth and power in the world.
37:03
When those holding the reserve currency and debt of the declining empire lose faith and sell them,
37:09
that marks the end of its big cycle. Of the roughly 750 currencies that existed since 1700,
37:17
less than 20% now exist, and all of them have been devalued.
37:23
For the Dutch, this happened after their defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, when they weren't able to repay
37:30
the massive debts they built up during it. This led to a run on the bank of Amsterdam
37:37
and a desperate sell off, forcing massive money printing,
37:43
which devalued the currency and the empire into irrelevance.
37:50
For the British, this happened after World War II, when despite their victory,
37:56
they could not repay the massive debts they borrowed to fund their war effort. This led to a series of money printing, devaluations,
38:06
and selloffs in the British pound as the US and the dollar emerged dominant
38:11
and created a new world order. At the time of this recording, the United States hasn't yet reached this point.
38:19
While it has massive debt, spends more than it earns and funds this deficit with more borrowing
38:25
and printing huge amounts of new money, the big sell off in dollars and dollar debt
38:30
hasn't yet begun. And while there are great internal and external conflicts
38:36
occurring for all the classic reasons, they've not yet crossed the line to become wars.
38:41
Eventually out of these conflicts, whether they're violent or not, come new winners who get together
38:47
and restructure the losers' debts and political systems and establish the new world order.
38:54
Then the old cycle and empire ends and the new one begins
39:00
and they do it all over again. That's a lot of detail I just threw at you to paint a picture of how the typical big cycle transpires.
39:09
Of course, not all of them transpire exactly this way, but most largely do, so much so
39:16
that it seems like the stories of rises and declines stay essentially the same
39:21
and the only things that change are the clothes the characters wear and the technologies they use.
39:28
So, where are we heading?
39:39
The future.
39:48
Most empires have their time in the sun and inevitably decline.
39:55
Reversing a decline is difficult because that requires undoing a lot that's already been done, but it's possible.
40:02
By looking at these indicators, it's pretty easy to see which stage of the big cycle an empire is in,
40:09
how fit it is, and whether its condition is improving or worsening,
40:16
which can help one estimate how many years it has left. Still, these estimates aren't precise
40:23
and the cycle can be extended if those in charge pay attention to their vital signs and improve them.
40:30
For example, knowing that a person is 60 years old, how fit they are, whether they smoke or not
40:38
and a few other basic vital signs, one can estimate the person's longevity.
40:44
One can do that with empires and their vital signs too. It won't be precise, but it will be broadly indicative
40:53
and give clear direction on steps to take to increase longevity.
40:58
It's most often the case that a nation's greatest war is with itself
41:03
over whether or not it can make the hard decisions needed to sustain success.
41:10
As for what we need to do, it comes down to just two things - earn more than we spend, and treat each other well.
41:19
All other things I mentioned - strong education, inventiveness, being competitive and all the rest -
41:26
are just ways of getting at these two things. It's easy to measure if we're doing them.
41:32
So like people who want to get fit, let's get on the program and improve our vitals.
41:38
Let's do that individually and collectively.
41:45
My goal for sharing this picture of how the world works and a few principles for dealing with it well
41:50
is to help you recognize where we are and the challenges we face, and to make the wise decisions needed
41:58
to navigate these times well.
42:06
Since there is a lot more to discuss and we are out of time, you can learn more in my book
42:12
Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. And I look forward to continuing this conversation
42:19
at economicprinciples.org and on social media. Thank you,
42:24
and may the force of evolution be with you.
