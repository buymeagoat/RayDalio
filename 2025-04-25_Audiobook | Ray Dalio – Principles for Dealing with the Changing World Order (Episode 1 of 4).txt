Introduction
1:41
Introduction. The times ahead will be radically different from those we've experienced in our lifetimes, though
1:48
similar to many times in history. How do I know that? Because
1:53
they always have been. Over the last 50 years or so, in order to handle my responsibilities
2:00
well, I've needed to understand the most important factors that go into making
2:05
countries and their markets succeed and fail. I learned that to anticipate and handle
2:12
situations that I never faced before, I needed to study as many analogous
2:18
historical cases as possible to understand the mechanics of how they
2:24
transpired. That gave me principles for dealing with them. Well, a few years ago, I observed the
2:32
emergence of a number of big developments that hadn't happened in my lifetime before, but had occurred
2:38
numerous times in history. Most importantly, I was seeing the confluence
2:44
of huge debts and zero or near zero interest rates that led to massive
2:51
printing of money in the world's three major reserve currencies. I was also seeing big political and
2:58
social conflicts within countries especially the United States due to the
3:04
largest wealth, political and values gaps in roughly a century. And also I saw the rising of a
3:14
new world power China to challenge the existing world power the United States
3:21
and the existing world order. The most recent analogous period
3:27
was the period from 1930 to 1945. This was very concerning to
3:34
me. I knew that I couldn't really understand what was happening and deal with what would be coming at me unless I
3:42
studied past analogous periods, which led me to study the rises and declines
3:48
of empires, their reserve currencies, and their markets. In other words, to
3:54
develop an understanding of what is happening now and might happen over the next few years, I needed to study the
4:01
mechanics behind similar cases in history such as the 1930 to 45 period,
4:09
the rise and fall of the Dutch and British empires, the rise and fall of
4:14
Chinese dynasties and others. To be clear, while I am describing these
4:20
cycles of the past, I'm not one of those people who believes that what happened
4:25
in the past will necessarily continue in the future without understanding the
4:30
cause effect mechanics that drive changes. My objective above all else is to have
4:38
you join me in looking at the cause effect relationships and then to use
4:44
that understanding to explore what might be coming at us and agree on principles
4:50
to handle it in the best possible way. I was in the midst of doing these
4:55
studies when the coid9 pandemic struck which was another one of those big
5:01
events that never happened in my lifetime but happened many times before.
5:07
Past pandemics became a part of this study and showed me that surprising acts
5:13
of nature, diseases, famines, and floods need to be considered as possibilities
5:20
because those surprising big acts of nature that rarely come along were by
5:26
any measure even more impactful than the biggest depressions and wars.
5:33
As I studied history, I saw that it typically transpires through relatively
5:39
well-defined life cycles like those of organisms that evolve as each generation
5:46
transitions to the next. In fact, the history and the future of humanity can
5:52
be seen as just the aggregate of all the individual life stories evolving through
5:58
time. I saw these stories flow together as one. all-encompassing story from the
6:05
beginning of recorded history up to this moment with the same things happening
6:10
over and over again for basically the same reasons while still
6:16
evolving. By seeing many interlinking cases evolve together, I could see the
6:22
patterns and the cause effect relationships that govern them and could imagine the future based on what I
6:29
learned. These events happened many times throughout history and were parts of a
6:35
cycle of rises and declines of empires and most aspects of empires. For
6:41
example, their education levels, their levels of productivity, their levels of
6:47
trade with other countries, their militaries, their currencies and other
6:52
markets and so on. Each of these aspects or powers
6:58
transpired in cycles and they were all interrelated. For example, nations
7:04
levels of education affected their levels of productivity which affected
7:09
their levels of trade with other countries which affected the levels of military strength required to protect
7:16
trade routes which together affected their currencies and other markets which
7:21
affected many other things. Their movements together made up the economic
7:27
and political cycles that occurred over many years. For example, a very
7:33
successful empire or dynasty could have its cycle last two or 300 years. All the
7:40
empires and dynasties I studied rose and declined in a classic big cycle that has
7:48
clear markers that allow us to see where we are in it.
7:53
This big cycle produces swings between first peaceful and prosperous periods of
8:02
great creativity and productivity that raise living standards a lot. and
8:10
alternatively depression, revolution and war periods when there is a lot of
8:16
fighting over wealth and power and a lot of destruction of wealth, life and other
8:21
things we cherish. I saw that the peaceful creative periods last much longer than
8:29
the depression, revolution, war periods, typically by a ratio of about
8:35
5:1. So, one could say that the depression, revolution, war periods were
8:42
transition periods between the normally peaceful creative
8:48
periods. While the peaceful creative periods are certainly more enjoyable for
8:53
most people, all these realities have their purposes for advancing evolution.
9:00
So, in the broader sense, they are neither good nor bad. The depression,
9:06
revolution, war periods produce a lot more destruction, but like cleansing
9:12
storms, they get rid of weaknesses and excesses, such as having too much debt,
9:19
and they produce a new beginning in the form of a return to fundamentals on a
9:25
sounder footing, albeit painfully. After the conflict is
9:30
resolved, it is clear who has what power. And because most people
9:36
desperately want peace by then, there is a resolution that produces new monetary,
9:44
economic, and political systems together, a new world order, and that
9:51
fosters the next peaceful creative period.
9:57
Within this big cycle are other cycles. For example, there are long-term debt
10:03
cycles that last about a 100red years and short-term debt cycles that last about 8 years. This short-term cycle
10:11
also has within it longer prosperous expansion periods that are interrupted
10:17
by shorter recession periods. And within these cycles are shorter cycles and so
10:24
on. Before I get your head spinning with all this cycle stuff, the main thing I
10:30
want to convey is that when the cycles align, the tectonic plates of history
10:36
shift and the lives of all people change in big ways. These shifts will sometimes
10:43
be terrible and sometimes be terrific. They certainly will happen in the future
10:49
and most people will fail to anticipate them. In other words, the swinging of
10:56
conditions from one extreme to another in a cycle is the norm, not the
11:02
exception. It was a very rare country in a very rare century that didn't have at
11:09
least one boom, harmonious, prosperous period and one depression, civil war,
11:18
revolution period. So we should expect both. Yet most people throughout history
11:25
have thought and still think today that the future will look like a slightly
11:30
modified version of the recent past. That is because the really big
11:37
boom periods and the really big bust periods like many things come along
11:44
about once in a lifetime. And so they are surprising unless one has studied
11:50
the patterns of history over many generations. Because the swings between
11:56
great and terrible times tend to be far apart, the future we encounter is likely
12:03
to be very different from what most people expect.
12:08
For example, my dad and most of his peers who went through the Great Depression and World War II never
12:16
imagined the postwar economic boom because it was more different
12:23
from similar to what they had experienced. I understand why given
12:30
those experiences they wouldn't think of borrowing and putting their hard-earned
12:35
savings into the stock market. So it's understandable that they missed out on
12:41
profiting from the boom. Similarly, I understand why decades
12:47
later, those who only experienced debt finance booms and never experienced
12:53
depression and war would borrow a lot in order to speculate and would consider
12:59
depression and war implausible. The same is true with money. Money used to be hard like linked
13:08
to gold after World War II until governments made money soft. We call
13:14
that fiat to accommodate borrowing and prevent entities from going broke in the
13:21
1970s. As a result, most people at the moment of my writing this book believe that
13:29
they should borrow more even though borrowing and debt finance booms have historically led to depressions and
13:36
internal and external conflicts. Understanding history in this
13:42
way also raises questions whose answers provide us with valuable clues on what
13:48
the future might be like. For example, throughout my life, the dollar has been the world's reserve
13:54
currency. Monetary policy has been an effective tool for stimulating
13:59
economies, and democracy and capitalism have been widely regarded as the
14:05
superior political and economic systems. Anyone who studies history can
14:11
see that no system of government, no economic system, no currency, and no
14:17
empire lasts forever. Yet most everyone is surprised and ruined when they
14:24
fail. Naturally, I asked myself, how would I and the people I care about know
14:30
when we are entering one of those depression, revolution, war periods? And
14:37
how would we know how to navigate them? Well, because my professional
14:42
responsibility is to preserve wealth regardless of the environment, I needed
14:48
to develop an understanding and strategy that would have worked throughout
14:54
history, including through these sorts of devastating times. The purpose of this audio book is
15:02
to pass along what I learned that has helped me and that I believe might help you. I present it for your
15:11
[Music] consideration. How I learned to anticipate the future by studying the
15:19
past. While it might seem odd that an investment manager who was required to
15:24
make investment decisions on short time frames would pay so much attention to
15:30
long-term history. Through my experience, I have learned that I need this perspective.
15:38
My approach isn't an academic one created for scholarly purposes. It's a very practical one that I follow in
15:45
order to do my job well. The game I play requires me to understand what is likely
15:52
to happen to economies better than the competition does. So I have spent
15:57
roughly 50 years closely observing most major economies and their markets as
16:04
well as their political conditions since those affect both trying to understand
16:11
what is happening well enough to bet on it. From my years of wrestling with the
16:16
markets and trying to come up with principles for doing it well, I've learned that one's ability to anticipate
16:25
and deal well with the future depends on one's understanding of the cause effect
16:32
relationships that make things change. And one's ability to understand these
16:38
cause effect relationships comes from studying how they have changed in the
16:45
past. I arrived at this approach after the painful learning that the big
16:51
mistakes in my career came from missing big market moves that hadn't happened in
16:57
my lifetime before but happened many times before that. The first of these
17:04
big surprises for me came in 1971 when I was 22 years old and
17:10
clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as a summer job. I loved
17:16
it because it was a fastpaced game of making and losing money played on a trading floor with people who like to
17:23
have a blast with each other. So much so that traders used to have water pistol
17:29
fights right on the trading floor. I was engrossed in this game of watching
17:35
the big developments in the world and betting on how they would drive markets.
17:40
Sometimes it could be dramatic. On a Sunday night, August
17:45
15th, 1971, President Richard Nixon announced
17:51
that the US would reneg on its promise to allow paper dollars to be turned in
17:56
for gold. As I listened to Nixon speak, I realized that the US government had defaulted on
18:04
a promise and that money as we knew it had ceased to
18:09
exist. That couldn't be good. So I thought. So on Monday morning, I walked
18:16
onto the floor of the exchange expecting pandemonium as stocks took a
18:21
dive. There was pandemonium, all right, but not the sort I expected. Instead of
18:28
falling, the stock market jumped about 4% as the dollar plummeted. I was
18:34
shocked. That's because I hadn't experienced a currency devaluation
18:39
before. In the days that followed, I dug into history and saw that there were
18:45
many cases of currency devaluations that had similar effects on stock markets. By
18:52
studying further, I figured out why. and I learned something valuable that would
18:59
help me many times in my future. It took a few more of those painful surprises to
19:04
beat the realization into my head that I needed to understand all the big
19:10
economic and market moves that happened in the last 100 plus years in all major
19:16
countries. In other words, if some big and important event had happened in the
19:22
past, like the Great Depression, I couldn't say for sure that it wouldn't
19:28
happen to me. So, I had to figure out how it worked and be prepared to deal
19:34
with it. Through my research, I saw that there were many cases of the same types
19:39
of things happening like depressions and that by studying them like a doctor
19:45
studies many cases of a particular type of disease, I could gain a deeper
19:52
understanding of how they work. I studied these qualitatively and
19:59
quantitatively through my experiences by speaking with preeminent experts,
20:04
reading great books, and digging into statistics and archives with the help of
20:10
my great research team. From that learning came a
20:15
visualization of an archetypical sequence of how rises and declines in
20:21
wealth and power typically happen. The archetype helps me see the cause
20:28
effect relationships that drive how these cases typically progress. With that archetypical
20:35
template specified, I can study deviations from it to try to explain
20:41
them. Then I put these mental models into algorithms, both to monitor
20:47
conditions relative to my archetypes and to help me make decisions based on them.
20:54
This process helps me refine my understanding of the cause effect relationships to the point where I can
21:01
create decisionmaking rules. In other words, principles for dealing with my
21:07
realities in the form of if then statements. In other words, if X
21:14
happens, then make Y bet. Then I watch actual events transpire
21:20
relative to that template and what we are expecting. I do these things in a
21:26
very systematic way with my partners at Bridgewwater. If events are on track, we
21:32
continue to bet on what typically comes next. If events start to deviate from
21:37
our template, we try to understand why and course correct. This process has helped me both
21:44
understand the big cause effect sequences that typically drive their progressions and it has helped me gain a
21:52
lot of humility. I do this continuously and will do it until I die. So what you are
21:59
hearing is a work in progress. For example, I have followed this
22:04
approach for debt cycles because I had to navigate many of them over the last
22:10
50 years and they are the most important force driving big shifts in economies
22:15
and markets. If you're interested in my template for understanding big debt crisis and seeing
22:22
all of the cases that make it up, you can get principles for navigating big
22:28
debt crisis in digital form at
22:34
economicprinciples.org or in print form for sale at bookstores or online. I've
22:40
studied many big important things such as depressions, hyperinflations, wars,
22:47
balance of payments, crisis. By following this approach, usually because I was compelled to
22:54
understand unusual things that appeared to be germinating around me. It was that
23:01
perspective that allowed Bridgewater to navigate the 2008 financial crisis well
23:06
while others struggled. This approach affects how I see
23:14
everything. Seeing events in this way has helped shift my perspective from
23:19
being caught in the blizzard of things coming at me to stepping above them to
23:25
see the patterns through time. For example, in building and running my business, I had to understand the
23:32
realities of how people think and learn principles for dealing with these realities well, which I did using the
23:39
same approach. If you're interested in what I learned about such non-economic
23:44
and non-market things, I conveyed it in my book, Principles, Life, and Work,
23:50
which is free in an iOS Android app called Principles in Action or is for
23:56
sale in the usual bookstores. The more related things I could understand in this way, the more I
24:04
could see how they influence each other. for example, how the economic cycle
24:10
works with the political cycle and how they interact over longer periods of
24:17
time. I believe that the reason people typically miss the big moments of
24:22
evolution coming at them in life is because they experience only tiny pieces
24:29
of what's happening. We are like ants preoccupied with our jobs of carrying
24:34
crumbs in our very brief lifetimes instead of having broader perspectives
24:40
of big picture patterns and cycles the important interrelated things driving
24:46
them where we are within the cycle and what's likely to
24:52
transpire. From gaining this perspective, I've come to believe that throughout history, there are only a
24:59
limited number of personality types going down a limited number of paths
25:04
which lead them to encounter a limited number of situations to produce a
25:10
limited number of stories that repeat over time. Practically the only things
25:15
that change are the clothes the characters are wearing, the languages they are speaking, and the technologies
25:22
they're using. In my book, Principles, Life, and Work, I share my perspective
25:28
on these different ways of thinking. I won't describe them here, but we'll direct you there should you be
25:36
interested. This study and how I came to do it.
25:42
One study led to another which led me to do this study. More
25:48
specifically, studying money and credit cycles throughout history made me aware of the long-term debt and capital market
25:55
cycle, which typically lasts about 50 to 100 years, which led me to view what is
26:02
happening now in a very different way than if I hadn't gained that perspective.
26:09
For example, interest rates hit 0% and central banks printed money and bought
26:16
financial assets in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
26:21
I had studied that happening in the 1930s, which helped me see how and why
26:27
central bank actions of creating a lot of money and credit or debt 90 years ago
26:33
pushed financial asset prices up, which widened the wealth gap and led to an era
26:40
of populism and conflict. We are now seeing the same
26:45
forces at play in the post208 period.
26:51
In 2014, I wanted to forecast economic growth rates in a number of countries
26:56
because they were relevant to our investment decisions. I used the same approach of studying many cases to find
27:03
the drivers of growth and come up with timeless and universal indicators for anticipating count's growth rates over
27:10
10-year periods. Through this process, I developed a deeper understanding of why some
27:17
countries did well and others did poorly. I combined these indicators into
27:23
gauges and equations that we used and continue to use to produce 10-year
27:29
growth estimates across the 20 largest economies. Besides being helpful to us, I saw that
27:36
this study could help economic policy makers because by seeing these timeless
27:42
and universal cause effect relationships, they can know that if they changed X, it would have Y effect
27:50
in the future. I also saw how these 10-year leading
27:55
economic indicators such as the quality of education, the level of indebtedness
28:00
and so on were worsening for the US relative to big emerging countries like
28:07
China and India. This study is called productivity
28:12
and structural reform. Why countries succeed and fail and what should be done
28:18
so failing countries succeed. This study and every other study
28:23
mentioned here is available for free at economicprinciples.org.
28:30
Then soon after the Trump election in 2016 and with increases in populism in
28:37
developed countries becoming more apparent, I began a study called
28:43
populism the phenomenon that highlighted for me how gaps in wealth and values led to deep
28:51
social and political conflicts in the 1930s that are similar to those that
28:57
exist now. It also showed me how and why populists of the left and populists of
29:03
the right are more nationalistic, militaristic, protectionist and
29:11
confrontational and what such approaches led to. I saw how powerful the conflict
29:18
between those of the economic and political left and those of the right
29:24
could become and the significant impact that this conflict has on economies,
29:30
markets, wealth, and power. And that gave me a better understanding of events
29:37
that were and still are transpiring. From doing these studies
29:43
and from observing numerous things that were happening around me, I saw that
29:48
America was experiencing large gaps in people's economic conditions which were
29:55
obscured by looking at only economic averages. So I divided the economy into quintiles
30:03
looking at the top 20% of income earners, the next 20% and so on down to
30:09
the bottom 20% and examined the conditions of these populations
30:14
individually. This resulted in two studies in the one
30:20
that is titled our biggest economic social and political issue the two
30:26
economies dash the top 40% and the bottom 60% I saw the dramatic
30:34
differences in conditions between the halves and the have knots which helped
30:40
me understand the greater polarity and populism I saw emerging.
30:45
Those findings, as well as the close contact my wife and I were having
30:51
through her philanthropic work dealing with the reality of wealth and opportunity gaps in Connecticut
30:58
communities and their schools led to the research that became my study called Why
31:05
and how capitalism needs to be reformed. At the same time, through my
31:12
many years of international dealings in and research on other countries, I saw
31:17
huge global, economic and geopolitical shifts taking place, especially in
31:24
China. I have been going to China for 37 years and I'm lucky enough to have
31:30
become well acquainted with the thinking of top economic policy makers and a
31:36
broad range of others. Having this direct contact has helped me see up
31:41
close the reasoning behind their actions which have produced remarkable
31:48
advances. It is a fact that these people have led China to become an effective
31:53
competitor with the US in production, trade, technology,
31:59
geopolitics and world capital markets. So how they've done this must be
32:05
examined and understood without bias. My most recent study on which this audio
32:12
book is based came about because of my need to understand three big forces that
32:19
hadn't happened before in my lifetime and the questions they
32:25
prompt. First, the long-term debt and capital market cycle. At no point in our
32:33
lifetimes have interest rates been so low or negative on so much debt as they
32:39
are as of this writing. The value of money and debt assets is being called into question by
32:47
the supply demand picture for them. In 2021, more than $16 trillion of debt was
32:56
at negative interest rates, and an unusually large amount of additional new
33:03
debt will soon need to be sold to finance deficits. This is happening at the same
33:10
time as huge pension and health care obligations loom large on the horizon.
33:17
These circumstances raised some interesting questions for me. Naturally,
33:22
I wondered why anyone would want to hold debt yielding a negative interest rate
33:29
and how much lower interest rates could be pushed. I also wondered what will
33:35
happen to economies and markets when they can't be pushed lower and how
33:40
central banks could be stimulative when the next downturn inevitably comes.
33:46
Would central banks print a lot more currency causing its value to go
33:52
down? What would happen if the currency that the debt is denominated in goes
33:58
down while interest rates are so low? These questions in turn led me to
34:03
ask what central banks would do if investors flee debt denominated in the
34:09
world's major reserve currencies. In other words, the dollar, the euro, and the yen.
34:15
which would be expected if the money that they are being paid back in is both
34:21
depreciating in value and paying interest rates that are so low. A reserve currency is a currency
34:30
that is accepted around the world for transactions and savings. The country that gets to print
34:36
the world's primary currency, now the United States, but we'll see that this
34:42
has changed through history. That country is in a very rare and powerful
34:49
position and the debt that is denominated in the world's reserve
34:54
currency. In other words, now the US dollar debt is the most fundamental
35:00
building block for the world's capital markets and the world's economy.
35:06
It is also the case that all reserve currencies in the past have ceased to be
35:12
reserve currencies, often coming to traumatic ends for the countries that
35:18
enjoyed this special power. So I also began to wonder whether, when, and why
35:26
the dollar will decline as the world's leading reserve currency. What might
35:31
replace it? and how that would change the world as we know
35:37
it. The second big force is the internal order and disorder
35:43
cycle. Wealth, values, and political gaps are now larger than at any other
35:50
point during my lifetime. By studying the 1930s and other prior
35:56
eras when polarization was also high, I learned that which side wins out, the
36:02
left or the right, will have very big impacts on economies and
36:07
markets. So naturally, I wondered what today's gaps will lead to.
36:14
My examinations of history have taught me that when wealth and values gaps are
36:19
large and there is an economic downturn, it is likely that there will be a lot of
36:26
conflict about how to divide the pie. How will people and policymakers
36:31
interact with each other when the next economic downturn arrives?
36:37
I was especially concerned because of the limitations on central bank's ability to cut interest rates adequately
36:44
to stimulate the economy. In addition to these traditional tools
36:50
being ineffective, printing money and buying financial assets, now called
36:55
quantitative easing, also widens the wealth gap because buying financial
37:01
assets pushes up their prices, which also benefits the wealthy who hold more
37:07
financial assets than the poor do. How would that play out in the future?
37:15
The third big force is the external order and disorder cycle. For the first
37:21
time in my life, the United States is encountering a true rival of power. The
37:28
Soviet Union was only a military rival, never a significant economic one. China
37:34
has become a rival power to the United States in most ways, and it is becoming
37:40
stronger in most ways at a faster pace. If trends continue, China will be
37:46
stronger than the United States in the most important ways that an empire becomes
37:51
dominant or at the very least it will be a worthy competitor.
37:58
I have seen both countries up close for most of my life and I now see how
38:04
conflict is increasing fast especially in the areas of trade,
38:11
technology, geopolitics, capital and economic,
38:17
political, social ideologies. I can't help but wonder how these
38:23
conflicts and the changes in the world order that will result from them will
38:29
transpire in the years ahead and what effects that will have on us
38:35
all. To gain the perspective I needed about these factors and what their
38:40
confluence might mean, I looked at the rises and declines of all the major
38:46
empires and their currencies over the last 500 years, focusing most closely on
38:52
the three biggest ones. The US empire and the US dollar, which are most
38:59
important now. the British Empire and the British pound which were most
39:04
important before that and the Dutch Empire and the Dutch Gilder before
39:10
that. I also focus less closely on six other significant though less
39:17
financially dominant empires of Germany, France, Russia, Japan, China and
39:25
India. Of those six, I gave China the most attention and looked at its history
39:32
back to the year 600 because first, China was so important throughout
39:38
history. Second, it is so important now and will likely be even more important
39:44
in the future. And third, it provides many cases to look at dynasties rising
39:50
and declining, which helped me better understand the patterns and forces behind them. In examining these cases, a
39:58
clearer picture emerged of how other influences, most importantly technology
40:04
and acts of nature, played significant roles. From examining all of these cases across
40:11
empires and across time, I saw that the great empires typically lasted roughly
40:16
250 years, give or take 150 years, with big economic debt and political cycles
40:24
within them lasting about 50 to 100 years. By studying how these rises and
40:31
declines worked individually, I could see how they worked on average in an archetypical way
40:38
and then I could examine how they work differently and why. Doing that taught me a lot. My
40:46
challenge now is trying to convey it to you. You can miss these cycles if you watch
40:53
events too close up or if you were looking at the averages rather than the
40:59
individual cases. Almost everyone talks about what is happening now and nobody talks about
41:07
these big cycles even though they are the biggest drivers of what is happening
41:13
now. When looking at the whole or at averages, you don't see the individual
41:20
cases of rises and declines which are far greater. For example, looking at a stock market
41:28
average, let's say the S&P 500 average, and not looking at individual companies,
41:35
will lead you to miss the important fact that almost all of the individual cases
41:42
that make up the average have periods of birth, growth, and death.
41:48
For example, almost all companies that existed a 100red years ago have died and
41:54
new ones were born to replace them. But that's not apparent in the
42:00
average. If you experienced any one of these through their full ride, you would
42:06
have had a hell of a ride up followed by a hell of a ride down into ruin unless
42:12
you diversified and rebalanced your bets. the way is done by the S&P 500 to
42:19
create that index or you would have had to discern
42:24
the rising periods from the declining periods ahead of the crowd so you would
42:30
have been able to move well by move I don't mean just move your
42:36
positions in the markets in the case of rising and falling empires I mean move
42:42
in nearly everything including where you live. This leads me to my next point. To
42:50
see the big picture, you can't focus on the details. While I will attempt to paint
42:57
this big sweeping picture accurately, I can't paint it in a
43:02
precise way and also have you see it. Also, in order for you to see it and
43:09
understand it, you can't try to do that in a precise way.
43:15
That is because we are looking at mega macro cycles and evolution over long
43:21
time frames. To see them, you will have to let go of the
43:27
details. Of course, when the details are important, which they often are, we will
43:32
need to go from the very big imprecise picture to a more detailed one.
43:39
Looking at what happened in the past from this mega macro perspective will
43:45
radically alter how you see things. For example, because the span of time
43:50
covered is so large, many of the most fundamental things that we take for granted and many of the terms we use to
43:59
describe them do not exist over the full period of time. As a result, I will have
44:06
to be imprecise in my wording so that I can convey the big picture without
44:11
getting tripped up on what might seem to be big things but in the scope of what
44:16
we are looking at are relative details. For example, I wrestled with
44:23
how much I should worry about the differences between countries, kingdoms,
44:28
nations, states, tribes, empires, and dynasties.
44:34
Nowadays, we think mostly in terms of countries. However, countries as we know
44:40
them didn't come into existence until the 17th century after the 30 years war
44:45
in Europe. In other words, before then there were no countries. Generally
44:51
speaking, though not always, kingdoms are small, countries are bigger, and empires are biggest, spreading beyond
44:59
the kingdom or the country. The relationships between them are often not
45:04
all that clear. The British Empire was mostly a kingdom that gradually evolved
45:11
into mostly a country and then into an empire that extended beyond England's
45:17
borders so that its leaders controlled broad areas and many non-English
45:24
peoples. It's also the case that each of these types of singularly controlled entities,
45:32
states, countries, kingdoms, tribes, empires, etc., controls its population
45:39
in different ways, which further confuses things for those who seek
45:44
precision. For example, in some cases, empires are
45:49
areas that are occupied by a dominant power, while in other cases, empires are
45:56
areas influenced by a dominant power through threats and rewards. The British Empire generally
46:04
occupied the countries in its empire, while the American Empire has controlled
46:10
more via rewards and threats. Though that is not entirely true as at the time
46:17
of this writing the US has military bases in at least 70
46:22
countries. Though it is clear that there is an American empire, it is less clear
46:29
what is in it. Anyway, you get my point that trying to be precise can stand in
46:35
the way of conveying the biggest, most important things. So, you're going to have to bear with my sweeping
46:42
imprecisions. You will also understand why I will henceforth imprecisely call
46:49
these entities countries even though not all of them were countries technically
46:55
speaking. Along these lines, some will argue that my comparing different countries with different systems in
47:03
different times is impossible. While I can understand that perspective,
47:08
I want to assure you that I will seek to explain whatever major differences exist
47:15
and that the timeless and universal similarities are much greater than the
47:21
differences. It would be tragic to let the differences stand in the way of
47:27
seeing the similarities that provide us with the lessons of history that we
47:33
need. Remember that what I don't know is much
47:38
greater than what I do know. In asking these questions from the
47:44
outset, I felt like an ant trying to understand the universe. I had many more questions than
47:51
answers and I knew that I was delving into numerous areas that others have
47:56
devoted their lives to studying. One of the benefits of my circumstances
48:02
is that I can speak with the world's best scholars who have studied history in depth as well as with people who are
48:09
in or have been in positions of making history. This allowed me to triangulate
48:16
with the best of them. While each had in-depth perspectives on some pieces of the puzzle, none had the
48:24
holistic understanding that I needed to adequately answer all my questions. But by speaking with all of
48:31
them and triangulating what I learned with the research I did myself, the
48:37
pieces started to fall into place. The people and tools at Bridgewater were
48:43
also invaluable to this research because the world is a complicated place.
48:50
Playing the highly competitive game of making sense of the past, processing
48:55
what's going on in the present, and using that information to bet on the future requires hundreds of people and
49:03
great computer power. For example, we actively consume about a 100 million
49:08
data series that are run through our logic frameworks that systematically
49:14
convert this information into trades in every market we trade within every major
49:20
country in the world. I believe that our ability to see and process information
49:26
about all major countries and all major markets is unparalleled.
49:31
It was through this machine that I could see and attempt to understand how the
49:37
world I'm living in works, and I relied on it to do this
49:43
study. Still, I can't be sure that I'm right about anything.
49:49
While I have learned an enormous amount that I will put to good use, I know that
49:55
what I know is still only a tiny portion of what I need to know to be confident
50:02
in my outlook for the future. I also know from experience that
50:07
if I wait to learn enough to be satisfied with what I know before acting
50:12
or sharing, I'd never be able to use or convey what I have learned.
50:18
So, please understand that while this study will provide you with my very
50:24
top-down big picture perspective on what I've learned and my very low confidence
50:30
outlook for the future, you should approach my conclusions as theories
50:36
rather than facts. Keep in mind that even with all this, I
50:42
have been wrong more times than I can remember, which is why I value
50:47
diversification of my bets above all else. So, please realize that I'm just
50:54
doing the best I can to openly convey my thinking to you. You might be wondering why I wrote
51:02
this book. In the past, I would have been silent about what I've learned.
51:08
However, I'm now in the phase of life that silently achieving more isn't as
51:15
important to me as passing along what I've learned in the hope that it can be
51:20
of use to others. My main objectives are to convey to you my model for how the world works. To
51:28
share with you a single digestible story of the last 500 years that shows how and
51:35
why history rhymes with what is happening today and to help you and
51:40
others make better decisions so we all might have a better future.
51:48
how this study is organized. As with all my studies, I
51:54
will attempt to convey what I learned in both shorter, simpler ways, such as
51:59
videos you can find online, and longer, more comprehensive ways, like in this
52:06
audio book. and in even more comprehensive ways for those who want
52:13
additional charts and historical examples available in this case with
52:19
everything else not conveyed in this audio book at economicprinciples.org.
52:28
In order to make the most important concepts easy to understand, this book
52:33
is written in the vernacular, favoring clarity over precision. As a result,
52:40
some of my wording will be by and large accurate, but not always precisely so.
52:47
In part one, I will summarize all that I learned in a simplified archetype of the
52:54
rises and declines of empires, drawing from all my research of specific cases.
53:02
I will first distill my findings into an index of total power of empires which
53:08
provides an overview of the es and flows of different powers and which is
53:14
constituted from eight indices of different types of powers. I will then
53:19
go into more detail on a list of 18 determinants that I believe to be the
53:25
key forces behind the rises and falls of empires. and then I will cover in more
53:33
detail the three big cycles mentioned previously. In part two, I will show the
53:40
individual cases in greater depth, walking through the story of the major
53:45
reserve currency empires over the last 500 years, including a chapter focused
53:52
on the present-day conflicts between the United States and China.
53:58
Finally, in the concluding part three, I will discuss what all of this means for
54:04
the future. Part one, how the world
Part I: How the World Works - Chapter 1: The Big Cycle in a Tiny Nutshell
54:12
works. Chapter one, the big cycle in a tiny nutshell.
54:19
As explained in the introduction, the world order is now rapidly shifting in
54:25
important ways that have never happened in our lifetimes, but have happened many
54:30
times before. My objective is to show you those cases and the mechanics that drove
54:37
them and with that perspective attempt to imagine the future.
54:43
What follows here is an ultradistilled description of the dynamics that I saw
54:49
in studying the rises and declines of the last three reserve currency empires.
54:55
the Dutch, the British, and the American, and the six other significant
55:01
empires over the last 500 years, Germany, France, Russia, India, Japan,
55:09
and China, as well as all the other major Chinese dynasties back to the Tang
55:16
Dynasty in around the year 600. The purpose of this chapter is simply to
55:22
provide an archetype to use when looking at all the cycles, most importantly the
55:28
one that we're now in. In studying these past cases, I saw
55:33
clear patterns that occurred for logical reasons that I briefly summarize here
55:39
and cover more completely in subsequent chapters. While the focus of this chapter and this
55:45
audio book are on those that affected the big cyclical swings in wealth and
55:51
power, I also saw ripple effect patterns in all dimensions of life including
55:58
culture and the arts, social mores and more which I will touch on later.
56:06
Between this simple archetype and the cases shown in part two, we will see how
56:12
the individual cases fit the archetype, which is essentially the average of
56:17
those cases, and we will see how well the archetype describes the individual
56:24
cases. Doing this, I hope, will help us better understand what is happening.
56:31
Now, I'm on a mission to figure out how the world works and to gain timeless and
56:37
universal principles for dealing with it well. It's both a passion and a
56:42
necessity for me. While the curiosities and concerns that I described earlier
56:48
pulled me into doing this study, the process of conducting it gave me a much
56:53
greater understanding of the really big picture on how the world works than I
57:00
expected to get and I want to share it with you. It made much clearer to me how
57:06
peoples and countries succeed and fail over long swaths of time. It revealed
57:14
giant cycles behind the ups and downs that I never knew existed. And most
57:20
importantly, it helped me put into perspective where we now
57:26
are. For example, through my research, I learned that the biggest thing affecting
57:32
most people in most countries through time is the struggle to make, take, and
57:39
distribute wealth and power. Though they have always struggled over other things
57:44
too, most importantly ideology and religion. These struggles happened in
57:52
timeless and universal ways and had huge implications for all aspects of people's
57:58
lives unfolding in cycles like the tide coming in and out.
58:06
I also saw how throughout time and in all countries, the people who have the
58:12
wealth are the people who own the means of wealth production. In order to maintain and
58:19
increase their wealth, they work with the people who have the political power, who are in a symbiotic relationship with
58:26
them to set and enforce the rules. I saw how this happened similarly across
58:33
countries and across time. While the exact form of it has evolved and will
58:38
continue to evolve, the most important dynamics have remained pretty much the
58:44
same. The classes of those who were wealthy and powerful evolved over time.
58:51
For example, from monarchs and nobles who were land owners when agricultural
58:57
land was the most important source of wealth to capitalists and elected or
59:04
autocratic political officials. Now that capitalism produces capital
59:10
assets and that wealth and political power are generally not passed along in
59:17
families, but they still cooperated and competed in basically the same ways.
59:26
I saw how over time this dynamic leads to a very small percentage of the
59:32
population gaining and controlling exceptionally large percentages of the
59:37
total wealth and power. Then becoming overextended, and then encountering bad
59:45
times, which hurt those least wealthy and least powerful the hardest, which
59:51
then leads to conflicts that produce revolutions or civil wars. When these
59:57
conflicts are over, a new world order is created and the cycle begins again.
1:00:04
In this chapter, I will share more of this big picture synthesis and some of the details that go along with it. While
1:00:11
what you're hearing here are my own ideas, you should know that the ideas I
1:00:17
express in this audio book have been well triangulated with other experts.
1:00:24
About two years ago, when I felt that I needed to answer the questions I described in the introduction, I decided
1:00:32
to immerse myself in studying with my research team, digging through archives,
1:00:38
speaking with the world's best scholars and practitioners who each had indepth
1:00:44
understandings of bits and pieces of the puzzle, reading relevant great books by
1:00:50
insightful authors, and reflecting on the prior research I've done and the
1:00:56
experiences that I've had from investing globally for nearly 50
1:01:01
years. Because I view this as an audacious, humbling, necessary, and
1:01:08
fascinating undertaking, I'm worried about missing important things and being
1:01:13
wrong. So, my process is iterative. I do my research, write it up, show it
1:01:20
to the world's best scholars and practitioners to stress test it, explore potential improvements, write it up
1:01:28
again, stress test it again, and so on until I get to the point of diminishing
1:01:34
returns. This study is the product of that exercise. While I can't be sure that I have the
1:01:41
formula for what makes the world's greatest empires and their markets rise
1:01:46
and fall exactly right, I'm pretty confident that I got it by and large
1:01:53
right. I also know that what I learned is essential for my putting what is
1:01:58
happening now into perspective and for imagining how to deal with important
1:02:03
events that have never happened in my lifetime but have happened repeatedly
1:02:09
throughout history. Understanding the big
1:02:16
cycle. For reasons explained in this audio book, I believe that we are now seeing an archetypical big shift in
1:02:24
relative wealth and power and the world order that will affect everyone in all
1:02:31
countries in profound ways. This big wealth and power shift is not
1:02:36
obvious because most people don't have the patterns of history in their minds
1:02:42
to see this one as another one of those. So in this first chapter I will describe
1:02:49
in a very brief way how I see the archetypical mechanics behind rises and
1:02:55
declines of empires and their markets working. I have identified 18 important
1:03:02
determinants that have explained almost all of the basic es and flows through
1:03:07
time that have caused ups and downs in empires. We will look at them in a
1:03:13
moment. Most of them transpire in classic cycles that are mutually reinforcing in ways that tend to create
1:03:21
a single very big cycle of ups and downs.
1:03:27
This archetypical big cycle governs the rising and declining of empires and
1:03:34
influences everything about them, including their currencies and
1:03:39
markets. The most important three cycles are the ones I mentioned in the introduction. the long-term debt and
1:03:47
capital market cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle, and the external
1:03:54
order and disorder cycle. Because these three cycles are
1:03:59
typically the most important, we will be looking at them in some depth in later
1:04:05
chapters. Then we will apply them to history and the present day so that you
1:04:11
can see how they play out in real examples.
1:04:16
These cycles drive swings back and forth between opposites, swings between peace
1:04:23
and war, economic boom and bust, the political left and the political right
1:04:30
being in power, the coalescing and disintegrating of empires that typically
1:04:36
occur because people push things to extremes that surpass the equilibrium
1:04:43
levels which leads to swings that get overdone in the opposite
1:04:49
direction. Embedded in the swings in one direction are the ingredients that lead
1:04:56
to the swings in the opposite direction. These cycles have remained
1:05:01
essentially the same through the ages for essentially the same reason that the
1:05:07
fundamentals of the human life cycle have remained the same over the ages.
1:05:12
Because human nature doesn't change much over time. For example, fear, greed,
1:05:20
jealousy, and other basic emotions have remained constants and are big
1:05:26
influences that drive cycles. While it is true that no two people's
1:05:33
life cycles are exactly the same and the typical life cycle has changed over the
1:05:39
millennia, the archetype of the human life cycle of children being raised by
1:05:46
parents until they are independent, at which point they raise their own
1:05:51
children and work, which they do until they get old, retire, and die, remains
1:05:57
essentially the same. Similarly, the big money credit capital
1:06:02
market cycle which builds up too much debt and debt assets such as bonds until
1:06:08
the debt can't be serviced with hard money remains essentially the same. As
1:06:15
always, this leads to people trying to sell their dead assets to make purchases
1:06:21
and finding out they can't because there are far too many debt assets relative to
1:06:27
the amount of money and the value of the stuff there is to buy. Once this
1:06:34
happens, defaults prompt those who manufacture money to make more.
1:06:41
That cycle has been essentially the same for thousands of years. So have the cycles of internal
1:06:49
order and disorder and external order and disorder. We will explore how human
1:06:56
nature and other dynamics drive these cycles in the coming chapters.
1:07:03
[Music] evolution, cycles, and the bumps along
1:07:08
the way. Evolution is the biggest and only permanent force in the universe. Yet, we
1:07:16
struggle to notice it. While we see what exists and what
1:07:21
happens, we don't see evolution and the evolutionary forces that make things
1:07:27
exist and happen. Look around you. Do you see evolutionary change? Of course
1:07:35
not. Yet you know that what you are looking at is changing albeit slowly
1:07:41
from your perspective. And you know that in time it won't exist and other things will
1:07:49
exist in its place. To see this change we have to devise ways to measure things and watch
1:07:56
the measurements change. Then once we can see the change, we can
1:08:02
study why it happens. This is what we must do if we are going to successfully think about
1:08:08
the changes ahead and how to deal with them. Evolution, as I see it, is the
1:08:15
upward move toward improvement that occurs because of adaptation and
1:08:21
learning. Around it are cycles. To me, most everything transpires as an
1:08:28
ascending trajectory of improvement with cycles around it, like an upward
1:08:34
pointing corkcrew. Evolution is a relatively smooth and steady improvement because
1:08:41
the gaining of knowledge is greater than the losing of knowledge.
1:08:46
Cycles on the other hand move back and forth producing excesses in one
1:08:52
direction that lead to reversals and excesses in the other like the swinging
1:08:57
of a pendulum. For example, over time our living standards rise because we
1:09:03
learn more which leads to higher productivity. But we have ups and downs
1:09:09
in the economy because we have debt cycles that drive actual economic
1:09:14
activity up and down around that uptrend. These evolutionary and
1:09:21
sometimes revolutionary changes around the trend are not always smooth and
1:09:28
painless. Sometimes they are very abrupt and painful as mistakes are made, learning
1:09:35
occurs and better adaptations result. Together evolution and cycles
1:09:44
make the upward corkcrew type movements that we see in everything. Wealth,
1:09:50
politics, biology, technology, sociology, philosophy, etc.
1:09:58
Human productivity is the most important force in causing the world's total
1:10:04
wealth, power, and living standards to rise over time. Productivity, in other words, the
1:10:12
output per person driven by learning, building, and inventiveness has steadily improved over
1:10:20
time. However, it has risen at different rates for different people. though
1:10:27
always for the same reasons. Because of the quality of people's
1:10:32
education, inventiveness, work ethic, and economic systems to turn ideas into
1:10:40
output. These reasons are important for policymakers to understand in order to
1:10:46
achieve the best possible outcome for their countries and for investors and
1:10:52
companies to understand in order to determine where the best long-term investments are.
1:10:59
This constantly increasing trend is the product of humanity's capacity to evolve
1:11:07
which is greater than any other species because our brain gives us a unique
1:11:14
capacity to learn and think abstractly. As a result, our inventions
1:11:21
of technologies and ways of doing things have advanced uniquely. That evolution has led to the
1:11:28
continuous evolutions that make up the changing world order. Technological advances in
1:11:35
communications and transportation have brought everyone in the world closer
1:11:40
together which has changed the nature of relationships of people and empires in
1:11:46
profound ways. We see such evolutionary improvements apparent in just about
1:11:53
everything. greater life expectancy, better products, better ways of doing
1:11:59
things and so on. Even our way of evolving has evolved
1:12:04
in the form of coming up with better ways to create and innovate. This has been true for as long
1:12:13
as human history has been written. As a result of this, charts of most
1:12:19
everything show more upward slopes toward improvement than up and down
1:12:25
movements. This is shown in the first PDF charts. Estimated output, in other
1:12:33
words, estimated real GDP per person and
1:12:38
life expectancy over the last 500 years are shown in these charts.
1:12:44
These are probably the two most widely agreed upon measures of well-being. Though they are
1:12:51
imperfect, you could see the magnitudes of their evolutionary uptrends relative
1:12:57
to the magnitudes of the swings around them. The fact that the trends are so
1:13:03
pronounced relative to the swings around the trends shows how much more forceful
1:13:08
the power of human inventiveness is relative to everything else.
1:13:15
As shown from this top-down big picture perspective, output per person is
1:13:21
steadily improving, though very slowly in the early years and faster starting
1:13:26
in the 19th century when the slope becomes much steeper, reflecting the
1:13:32
faster productivity gains. This shift from slower productivity
1:13:38
gains to faster productivity gains was primarily due to the improvements in
1:13:45
broad learning and the conversion of that learning into
1:13:50
productivity. That was brought about by a number of factors going back as far as
1:13:56
Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in Europe in the mid5th century.
1:14:02
And by the way, China had invented it centuries before. That invention increased the
1:14:10
knowledge and education available to many more people, contributing to the
1:14:16
Renaissance, the scientific revolution, the enlightenment, the invention of
1:14:22
capitalism, and the first industrial revolution in Britain. All of which
1:14:29
raise the slope of that line to raise our living standards. We will delve into these
1:14:35
things shortly. The broaderbased improvements in productivity that came from the
1:14:41
invention of capitalism, entrepreneurship, and the industrial
1:14:47
revolution also shifted wealth and power away from an agriculture-based economy
1:14:54
in which land ownership was the principal source of power and monarchs
1:15:01
and nobles and clergy work together to maintain their grip on it. The shift
1:15:08
moved toward an industry-based economy in which inventive capitalists created
1:15:14
and owned the means of production of industrial goods and work together with those in government to maintain the
1:15:22
system that allowed them to have the wealth and power. In other words, since
1:15:28
the industrial revolution which brought about that change, we have been
1:15:33
operating in a system in which wealth and power have primarily come from the
1:15:40
combination of education, inventiveness, and
1:15:45
capitalism with those who run governments working with those who
1:15:51
control most of the wealth and education.
1:15:56
How this evolution with big cycles around it happens also continues to
1:16:02
evolve. For example, while ages ago agricultural land and agricultural
1:16:08
production were worth the most and that evolved into machines and what they
1:16:14
produced being worth the most. Digital things that have no apparent physical
1:16:20
existence are now evolving to become worth the most.
1:16:26
This is creating a fight over who obtains the data and how they use it to
1:16:31
gain wealth and power. At this time, humanity is evolving its ways of thinking and
1:16:38
increasing productivity in more dramatic ways than ever before, even more
1:16:44
dramatically than the discovery and usage of the scientific method. We are
1:16:50
doing this through the development of artificial intelligence which is an alternative way of thinking via an
1:16:58
alternative brain that can make discoveries and process them into
1:17:03
instructions of what should be done. Humanity is essentially creating an
1:17:09
alternative species that has enormous capacity to see past patterns and
1:17:15
process many different ideas very quickly. has little or no common sense,
1:17:21
has trouble understanding the logic behind relationships, and doesn't have
1:17:27
emotions. This species is simultaneously smart and stupid, helpful and dangerous.
1:17:34
It offers great potential and needs to be well controlled and not blindly
1:17:42
followed. the cycles around the uptrend. While significant because these
1:17:50
learnings and productivity improvements are evolutionary, they don't cause big
1:17:56
abrupt shifts in who has wealth and power. The big abrupt shifts come from
1:18:03
booms, busts, revolutions, and wars which are primarily driven by cycles.
1:18:10
And these cycles are driven by logical cause effect relationships.
1:18:17
For example, the forces of increased productivity, entrepreneurship, and
1:18:22
capitalism that marked the end of the 19th century also produced big wealth
1:18:28
gaps and overenddebtedness that led to economic downturns that in the first half of the
1:18:35
20th century led to anti- capitalism, communism, and big conflicts over wealth
1:18:42
and power within and between countries. What you can see is evolution marching
1:18:50
on with big cycles around it. Throughout time, the formula for success has been a
1:18:57
system in which well-educated people operating civily with each other come up
1:19:04
with innovations, receive funding through capital markets, and own the means of
1:19:11
production by which their innovations are turned into the production and
1:19:16
allocation of resources, allowing them to be rewarded by profitmaking.
1:19:24
However, over the long run, capitalism has created wealth and opportunity gaps
1:19:31
and overenddebtedness that have led to economic downturns and revolutions and
1:19:37
wars that have caused changes in the domestic and world orders.
1:19:45
As you can see in the next PDF charts, history shows that almost all of these
1:19:51
turbulent times were due to fighting over wealth and power. In other words,
1:19:58
conflicts in the form of revolutions and wars, often driven by money and credit
1:20:05
collapses and big wealth gaps, and severe acts of nature like droughts,
1:20:11
floods, and epidemics. It also shows that how bad these periods
1:20:17
get depends almost exclusively on how strong countries are and their abilities
1:20:25
to endure them. Countries with large savings, low debts,
1:20:31
and a strong reserve currency can withstand economic and credit collapses
1:20:37
better than countries that don't have much savings, have a lot of debt, and
1:20:42
don't have a strong reserve currency. Likewise, those who have
1:20:48
strong and capable leadership and civil populations can be managed better than
1:20:54
those that don't have these things. And those that are more inventive will adapt
1:21:00
better than those that are less inventive. As you will hear later, these
1:21:05
factors are measurable, timeless, and universal truths. Because these turbulent times
1:21:13
are small in relation to the evolutionary uptrend of humanity's
1:21:18
capacity to adapt and invent, they barely show up in the previous charts of
1:21:25
GDP and life expectancy, only appearing relatively minor as wiggles in those
1:21:32
charts. Yet, these wiggles seem very big to us because we are so small and
1:21:38
short-lived. Take the 1930 to 45 depression and war
1:21:44
period for example. The levels of the US stock market and global economic
1:21:49
activity are shown in the next PDF chart. As you can see, the economy fell
1:21:55
by about 10% and the stock market fell by about 85% and then began to recover.
1:22:04
This is part of the classic money and credit cycle that has happened for as long as there has been recorded history
1:22:11
and that I will explain more completely in chapter 3. Briefly, a credit collapse happens
1:22:18
because there is too much debt. Typically, the central government has to spend a lot of money it doesn't have and
1:22:26
make it easier for debtors to pay their debts. And the central bank always has
1:22:32
to print money and provide credit liberally like they did in response to
1:22:38
the economic plunge driven by the COVID pandemic and the production of a lot of
1:22:44
debt. The 1930s bust was the natural expansion of the roaring 20s boom that
1:22:51
became a debt finance bubble that popped in 1929.
1:22:56
that produced a depression that led to big central government spending and
1:23:02
borrowing financed by big money and credit creation by the central
1:23:08
bank. Back then, the popping of the bubble and the resulting economic bust
1:23:14
were the biggest influences on the 1930 to 45 period's internal and external
1:23:22
fights for wealth and power. Then like now and like in most cases,
1:23:30
there were large wealth gaps and conflict which when heightened by the
1:23:36
debt economic collapses led to revolutionary changes in social and
1:23:42
economic programs and big wealth transfers that were manifest in
1:23:47
different systems in different countries. Clashes and wars developed
1:23:52
over which of these systems? capitalism or communism, democracy or autocracy
1:23:59
were best. There are always arguments or fights between those who want to make
1:24:06
big redistributions of wealth and those who don't. In the
1:24:11
1930s, mother nature also gave the US a painful drought.
1:24:17
Looking over the whole of the cases I examined, past economic and market
1:24:23
declines lasted about 3 years, give or take a few years, depending on how long
1:24:30
it took to do the debt restructuring and/or debt monetization process.
1:24:36
The quicker the printing of money to fill the debt holes, the quicker the closing of the deflationary depression,
1:24:43
and the sooner the worrying about the value of money began.
1:24:49
In the 1930s US case, the stock market and the economy bottomed the day that
1:24:55
the newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced that he would
1:25:01
default on the government's promise to let people turn their money in for gold.
1:25:07
And the government would create enough money and credit so that people could get their money out of the banks and
1:25:14
others could get money and credit to buy things and invest. That took three and a half years from
1:25:21
the initial stock market crash in October 1929. In 2008, it took a few months from
1:25:29
the crash to the printing of money. In 2020, it took a few weeks. In the 1930s,
1:25:38
even after there was this printing of money, there was fighting over wealth and power within and between countries.
1:25:46
The emerging powers of Germany and Japan challenged the existing leading world
1:25:51
powers of Great Britain, France, and eventually the United States. The war
1:25:57
period raised the economic output of things that were used in the war. But it
1:26:02
would be a misnomer to call the war years
1:26:07
a measured in output per person, it was. That's because there was so much
1:26:14
destruction. At the end of the war, global GDP per capita had fallen by
1:26:20
about 12%, much of which was driven by declines in the economies of countries
1:26:27
that lost the war. The stress test that these years represented wiped out a lot,
1:26:33
made clear who the winners and losers were, and led to a new beginning and a
1:26:39
new world order in 1945. Classically, that was followed by
1:26:45
a lengthy period of peace and prosperity that became overextended so that all
1:26:51
countries are now 75 years later being stress
1:26:56
tested. Most cycles in history happen for basically the same reasons.
1:27:02
For example, the 1907 to 1919 period began with the panic of 1907 in the
1:27:10
United States, which like the 1929-32 money and credit crisis
1:27:16
following the roaring 20s was the result of a boom period, which was called the
1:27:22
Gilded Age in the United States, which was the same time as the Bell Hippo in
1:27:27
continental Europe and the Victorian era in Great Britain.
1:27:33
In other words, boom debt finance periods of great economic excess and
1:27:40
great wealth gaps happened also when there were large wealth gaps and they
1:27:47
led to big wealth redistributions and contributed to a world war.
1:27:54
The wealth redistributions like in the 1930 to45 period came about through
1:28:01
large increases in taxes and government spending, big deficits and big changes
1:28:07
in monetary policies that monetized the deficits. Then at the end of World War
1:28:14
I, the Spanish flu pandemic intensified the stress test and the resulting
1:28:20
restructuring process. This stress test and the global economic
1:28:26
geopolitical restructuring led to a new world order in 1919 which was expressed
1:28:33
in the treaty of Versailles. That began the new cycle. It
1:28:39
ushered in the 1920s debt finance boom which led to the 1930 to 45 period and
1:28:46
the same thing happening again. These periods of destruction and
1:28:55
reconstruction devastated the weak, made clear who the powerful were, and
1:29:01
established revolutionary new approaches to doing things. In other words, new
1:29:07
waters that set the stage for periods of prosperity that eventually became
1:29:15
overextended as debt bubbles with large wealth gaps. and led to debt busts that
1:29:23
produced new stress tests and again the destruction and reconstruction periods.
1:29:30
In other words, wars which led to new waters and eventually the strong again
1:29:38
gaining relative to the weak and so on. The cycles continued.
1:29:44
What are these destruction reconstruction periods like for the people who experience them? Since you
1:29:52
likely haven't been through one of these and the stories about them are very scary, the prospect of being in one is
1:30:00
worrisome to most people. It is true that these destruction reconstruction periods have produced
1:30:07
tremendous human suffering both financially and more importantly in lost
1:30:13
or damaged human lives. While the consequences are worse for some people,
1:30:18
virtually no one escapes the damage. Still, without minimizing them, history
1:30:24
has shown us that typically the majority of people stay employed in depressions
1:30:31
and are unharmed in shooting wars and survive natural disasters.
1:30:38
Some people who struggled through them have even described these very difficult
1:30:43
periods as bringing about important good things like drawing people closer
1:30:49
together, building strength of character, learning to appreciate the basics and so on. For example, Tom Bro
1:30:58
called the people who went through the 1930 to 45 period the greatest
1:31:04
generation because of the strength of character it gave them. My parents and
1:31:09
aunts and uncles who went through the Great Depression and World War II as well as others of their era whom I've
1:31:17
spoken to in other countries who went through their own versions of this destruction period saw it that way too.
1:31:26
Keep in mind that economic destruction periods and war periods typically don't
1:31:31
last very long, roughly 2 or 3 years. And the lengths and severities of
1:31:37
natural disasters like droughts and floods and pandemics vary, though they
1:31:43
typically lessen in painfulness as adaptations are made. One rarely gets
1:31:49
all three of these types of big crises. In other words, economic revolution and
1:31:55
war and natural disaster at the same time. My point is that while these
1:32:03
revolution war periods typically lead to a lot of human suffering, we should
1:32:09
never, especially in the worst of times, lose sight of the fact that one can
1:32:14
navigate them well. and that humanity's power to adapt and quickly get to new
1:32:21
and higher levels of well-being is much greater than all the bad stuff that
1:32:26
could be thrown at us. For that reason, I believe that it is smart to trust and
1:32:32
invest in humanity's adaptability and inventiveness. So, while I'm pretty sure that in the
1:32:39
coming years both you and I and the world will experience big challenges and
1:32:45
changes, I believe that humanity will become smarter and stronger in very
1:32:51
practical ways that will lead us to overcome these challenging times and go on to new and higher levels of
1:32:58
prosperity. Now let's look at the cycles of rises
1:33:04
and declines in wealth and power of the major countries over the last 500
1:33:12
years. Past big cycle shifts in wealth and
1:33:17
power. The chart of rising productivity shown earlier was for the whole world to
1:33:24
the best of our ability to measure it. It doesn't show the shifts in wealth and
1:33:29
power that occurred between countries. To understand how those happen, let's
1:33:35
start with the big picture basics. Throughout recorded history,
1:33:40
various forms of groups of people, in other words, tribes, kingdoms, countries, etc. have gained wealth and
1:33:48
power by building it themselves, taking it from others, or finding it in the
1:33:55
ground. When they gathered more wealth and power than any other group, they became the
1:34:01
world's leading power, which allowed them to determine the world order. When they lost that wealth and
1:34:09
power, which they all did, the world order and all aspects of life changed in
1:34:16
profound ways. The next PDF chart shows the relative
1:34:22
wealth and power of the 11 leading empires over the last 500
1:34:28
years. Each one of these indices of wealth and power is a composite of eight
1:34:34
different determinants that I will explain shortly. These indices are made up of a
1:34:40
number of different statistics. some of which are directly comparable and some
1:34:46
of which are broadly analogous or broadly indicative. In some cases, a data series
1:34:53
that stopped at a certain point had to be spliced with a series that continued
1:34:58
back in time. Additionally, the line shown on
1:35:03
the chart are a 30-year moving average of these indices shifted, so there's no
1:35:10
lag. I chose to use the smooth series because the volatility of the unsmood
1:35:17
series was too great to allow one to see the big movements. Going forward, I will use
1:35:23
these very smooth versions when looking at the very long-term and much less
1:35:29
smooth or unsmood versions when looking at these developments up close because
1:35:35
the most important developments are best captured this way.
1:35:40
Though these indices aren't perfect because all data throughout time isn't
1:35:46
perfect, they do an excellent job of painting the big picture. As you can
1:35:51
see, nearly all of the empires saw periods of ascendancy followed by
1:35:58
periods of decline. Take a moment to study the thicker lines on the chart, which
1:36:04
represent the four most important empires. the Dutch, British, American,
1:36:11
and Chinese. These empires held the last
1:36:16
three reserve currencies. The US dollar now, the British pound before that, and
1:36:23
the Dutch Gilder before that. China is included because it has risen to be the
1:36:29
second most powerful empire or country and because it was so consistently
1:36:35
powerful in most years prior to around 1850. To briefly summarize the story,
1:36:43
this chart shows, China was dominant for centuries, consistently outco competing Europe
1:36:50
economically and otherwise, though it entered into a steep decline starting in the
1:36:56
1800s. The Netherlands, a relatively small country, became the world's
1:37:03
reserve currency empire in the 1600s. The UK followed in a very similar path,
1:37:11
peaking in the 1800s. Finally, the United States rose
1:37:16
to become the world's superpower over the last 150 years, though particularly
1:37:22
during and after World War II. The US is now in relative decline,
1:37:29
while China is rising again. Now let's look at the same chart that
1:37:36
extends the data all the way back to the year 600. I focused on the first chart
1:37:42
which covers just the last 500 years rather than the second which covers the
1:37:48
last 1,400 years because it highlights the empires I studied most intently and
1:37:54
is simpler. Though with 11 countries, 12 major wars, and 500 years, it can hardly
1:38:02
be called simple. Still, the second is more extensive and worth glancing at. I left
1:38:10
out the shading of the war periods to lessen the complexity. As shown in the pre-1500
1:38:17
period, China was almost always the most powerful, though the Middle Eastern
1:38:22
caliphates, the French, the Mongols, the Spanish, and the Ottomans were also in
1:38:29
the picture. An important thing to remember, while the leading powers
1:38:36
covered in the study were the richest and most powerful, they weren't necessarily the best off countries for
1:38:43
two reasons. First, while wealth and power are what
1:38:48
most people want and will fight over most, some people and their countries
1:38:55
don't think that these things are the most important and wouldn't think of fighting over them, let alone dying for
1:39:01
them. Some people believe that having peace and savoring life are more important
1:39:08
than having a lot of wealth and power and wouldn't consider fighting hard enough to gain enough of the wealth and
1:39:15
power to make it into this study. So, some of them enjoyed greater amounts of
1:39:20
peace than those who fought for wealth and power. By the way, I think there is
1:39:26
a lot to be said for putting peace and savoring life ahead of gaining wealth and power. Interestingly, there was
1:39:34
little correlation between the wealth and power of a nation and the happiness
1:39:39
of its people, which is a subject for another time. Second, this group of countries excludes
1:39:47
what I will call the boutique countries like Switzerland and Singapore that
1:39:52
score very high in wealth and living standards but aren't large enough to
1:39:58
become one of the biggest empires. Eight determinants of wealth
1:40:05
and power. The single measure of wealth and power that I showed you for each country
1:40:13
in the prior charts is roughly an equal average of 18 measures of
1:40:20
strength. While we will explore the full list of determinants later, let's begin
1:40:26
by focusing on the key eight shown in the next chart.
1:40:32
They are education, competitiveness, innovation and
1:40:39
technology, economic output, share of world trade, military
1:40:46
strength, financial center strength, and reserve currency status.
1:40:53
This next PDF chart shows the average of each of these measures of strength
1:40:58
across all the empires I studied with the most weight on the most recent three
1:41:04
countries, the United States, the UK, and the Netherlands. I show where the key
1:41:10
indicators were in relation to their history by averaging them across the
1:41:15
cases. The chart is shown such that the value of one represents the peak in that
1:41:23
indicator relative to history and zero represents the trough. The timeline is
1:41:31
shown in years with zero representing roughly when the country was at its
1:41:37
peak. In other words, when the average across the gauges was at its peak. In
1:41:44
the rest of this chapter, we will walk through each of the stages of the archetype in more
1:41:51
detail. The lines in the chart do a pretty good job of telling the story of why and how the rises and declines took
1:41:58
place. You can see how rising education leads to increased innovation and technology,
1:42:06
which leads to an increased share of world trade and military strength,
1:42:11
stronger economic output, the building of the world's leading financial center,
1:42:17
and with a lag, the establishment of the currency as a reserve currency.
1:42:23
And you can see how for an extended period, most of these factors stayed
1:42:28
strong together and then declined in a similar order. The common reserve
1:42:34
currency, just like the world's common language, tends to stick around after an
1:42:40
empire has begun its decline because the habit of usage lasts longer than the
1:42:46
strengths that made it so commonly used. I call this cyclical interrelated move
1:42:55
up and down the big cycle. Using these determinants and some
1:43:02
additional dynamics, I will next describe the big cycle in more detail.
1:43:07
But before I start, it's worth reiterating that all of these measures of strength rose and declined over the
1:43:16
ark of the empire. That's because these strengths and weaknesses are mutually
1:43:22
reinforcing. In other words, strengths and weaknesses in education,
1:43:27
competitiveness, economic output, share of world trade, etc. contribute to the
1:43:34
others being strong or weak for logical reasons.
1:43:40
the archetypical big cycle. Broadly speaking, we could look
1:43:46
at these rises and declines as happening in three phases as shown in the
1:43:52
accompanying PDF chart. From one new water to the next
1:43:58
new water, there is the phase of the rise, then the phase of the top, and
1:44:05
then the phase of the decline. The
1:44:11
rise. The rise is the prosperous period of building that comes after a new water
1:44:17
which typically follows a war, whether that's a civil war or a world war. It is
1:44:23
when the country is fundamentally strong because there are relatively low levels
1:44:29
of indebtedness, relatively small wealth values and political gaps between
1:44:35
people. People working effectively together to produce prosperity, good
1:44:41
education and infrastructure, strong and capable leadership, and a peaceful world
1:44:47
order that is guided by one or more dominant world powers, which leads
1:44:54
to the top. This period is characterized by excesses
1:45:00
in the form of high levels of indebtedness, large wealth, values and political gaps, declining education and
1:45:08
infrastructure, conflicts between different classes of people within the countries and struggling between
1:45:15
countries as overextended empires are challenged by emerging rivals which
1:45:22
leads to the next stage, the decline. line. This is the painful period of
1:45:31
fighting and restructuring that leads to conflicts and changes in the establishment of new internal and
1:45:39
external orders. It sets the stage for the next order and a new period of
1:45:44
prosperous building. Let's look at each of these stages in more detail.
1:45:51
[Music] The rise. The rise phase begins when there
1:45:58
is strong enough and capable enough leadership to gain power and design an
1:46:05
excellent system to increase the country's wealth and power.
1:46:10
Looking at the historically great empires, this system typically involves
1:46:16
strong education, which is not just teaching knowledge and skills. It also
1:46:22
includes teaching strong character, civility, and work ethic
1:46:29
development. These are typically taught in families, schools, or religious
1:46:34
institutions. If done well, this provides a healthy respect for rules and
1:46:40
order within the society and it leads to low corruption rates and is effective in
1:46:47
encouraging people to work together to improve productivity. The better the country
1:46:54
does this, the more there will be a shift from producing basic products to
1:47:00
innovating and inventing new technologies. For example, the Dutch were superbly
1:47:08
inventive. At their peak, they came up with a quarter of all major inventions
1:47:14
in the world. One of these were ships that could travel around the globe to collect
1:47:20
great riches. They also invented capitalism as we know it. Innovation is
1:47:27
generally enhanced by being open to the best thinking in the world to be able to
1:47:34
learn the best ways of doing things and by the workers, the government and the
1:47:40
military all working well together. As a result of all these
1:47:46
things, the country becomes more productive and more competitive in world
1:47:52
markets, which shows up in its share of world trade rising. You can see this
1:47:58
happening today as the US and China are roughly comparable in both economic
1:48:05
outputs and their shares of world trade. As a country trades more globally, it
1:48:11
must protect its trade routes and foreign interests and it must be prepared to defend itself from attack so
1:48:19
it develops great military strength. If done well, this virtuous
1:48:25
cycle leads to strong income growth which can be used to finance investments
1:48:30
in infrastructure, education and research and development.
1:48:36
The country must develop systems to incentivize and empower those who have the ability to make or get
1:48:44
wealth. In all of these past cases, the most successful empires used a
1:48:50
capitalist approach to incentivize and develop productive entrepreneurs.
1:48:56
Even China which is run by the Chinese Communist Party uses a state capitalism
1:49:02
approach to incentivize and enable people. To do that incentivizing and
1:49:09
financial enabling well the country has to have developing capital markets most
1:49:17
importantly its lending bond and stock markets that allows people to convert
1:49:23
their savings into investments to fund innovation and development and to share
1:49:30
in the successes of those who are making great things happen. The inventive Dutch
1:49:36
created the first publicly traded listed company, the Dutch East India Company,
1:49:42
and the first stock market to fund it. These were integral parts of their
1:49:48
machine that produced a lot of wealth and power. As a natural consequence, all of
1:49:54
the greatest empires developed the world's leading financial centers for attracting and distributing the capital
1:50:02
of their times. Amsterdam was the world's financial center when the Dutch were preeminent.
1:50:09
London when the British were on top, New York is now. And China is developing its
1:50:16
own financial center in Shanghai. As the country expands its
1:50:21
international dealings to become the largest trading empire, its transactions
1:50:27
can be paid in its currency and people around the world want to save in it. So
1:50:33
it becomes the world's leading reserve currency which enables the country to
1:50:39
borrow more and at lower interest rates than other countries because others want
1:50:45
to lend in it. This series of cause effect
1:50:50
relationships leading to mutually supportive financial, political and military powers has gone together for as
1:50:58
long as there has been recorded history. All of the empires that became the most
1:51:04
powerful in the world followed this path to the
1:51:09
top. The top. In the top phase, the country
1:51:15
sustains the successes that fueled its rise. But embedded in the rewards of the
1:51:21
successes are the seeds of decline. Over time, obligations pile up,
1:51:28
breaking down the self-reinforcing circumstances that fueled the
1:51:34
rise. As people in the country, which is now rich and powerful, earn more, that
1:51:41
makes them more expensive and less competitive relative to people in other countries who are willing to work for
1:51:47
less. At the same time, people from other countries naturally copy the methods and
1:51:54
technologies of the leading power, which reduces the leading powers
1:52:00
competitiveness. For example, British ship builders hired Dutch designers to
1:52:05
design better ships that were built less expensively by British workers, making
1:52:12
them more competitive, which led the British to rise and the Dutch to decline.
1:52:19
Also, as people in the leading country become richer, they tend not to work as
1:52:24
hard. They enjoy more leisure, pursue the finer and less productive things in
1:52:30
life, and at the extreme become decadent. Values change from generation
1:52:36
to generation during the rise to the top, from those who had to fight to
1:52:42
achieve wealth and power to those who inherited it. The new generation is less
1:52:48
battleh hardened, steeped in luxuries and accustomed to the easy life, which makes them more vulnerable to
1:52:56
challenges. Additionally, as people get used to doing well, they increasingly
1:53:01
bet on the good times continuing and borrow money to do that, which leads to
1:53:07
financial bubbles. Within capitalist systems, financial gains come unevenly. So the
1:53:15
wealth gap grows. Wealth gaps are self-reinforcing because rich people use
1:53:20
their greater resources to expand their powers. They also influence the
1:53:26
political system to their advantage and give greater privileges to their children like better education causing
1:53:34
the gaps in values, politics and opportunities to develop between the
1:53:40
rich halves and the poor have nots. Those who are less welloff feel the
1:53:46
system is unfair. So resentments grow. As long as the living standards of
1:53:52
most people are still rising, these gaps and resentments don't boil over into
1:53:59
conflict. During the top, the leading country's financial picture begins to
1:54:05
change. Having a reserve currency gives it the exorbitant privilege of being able to
1:54:12
borrow more money, which gets it deeper into debt. This boosts the leading
1:54:18
empire spending power over the short term and weakens it over the long
1:54:24
term. Inevitably, the country begins borrowing excessively, which contributes
1:54:29
to the country's building up large debts with foreign lenders.
1:54:35
While this boosts spending power over the short term, it weakens the country's financial health and weakens the
1:54:42
currency over the long term. In other words, when borrowing and spending are
1:54:48
strong, the empire appears very strong, but its finances are in fact being
1:54:55
weakened because the borrowing sustains the country's power beyond its
1:55:00
fundamentals by financing both domestic overconumption and international
1:55:07
military conflicts required to maintain the empire. Also the cost of maintaining and
1:55:15
defending the empire become greater than the revenue it brings in. So having an
1:55:21
empire becomes unprofitable. For example, the British Empire became
1:55:27
massive, bureaucratic, and lost its competitive advantages as rival powers,
1:55:34
particularly Germany, soared, leading to an increasingly expensive arms race and
1:55:41
eventually world war. The richer countries get into debt
1:55:47
by borrowing from poorer countries that save more. That is one of the earliest
1:55:52
signs of a wealth and power shift. This started in the United States in the
1:55:58
1980s when it had a per capita income 40 times that of China's and started
1:56:05
borrowing from the Chinese who wanted to save in dollars because the dollar was
1:56:11
the world's reserve currency. If the empire begins to run out of new
1:56:18
lenders, those holding their currency begin to look to sell and get out rather
1:56:24
than to buy, save, and lend and get in. And the strength of the empire begins to
1:56:30
fall. The
1:56:35
decline. The decline phase typically comes from internal economic weakness
1:56:42
together with internal fighting or from costly external fighting or both.
1:56:51
Typically the country's decline comes gradually and then
1:56:56
suddenly internally when debts become very large and there is an economic
1:57:02
downturn and the empire can no longer borrow the money necessary to repay its
1:57:07
debts. This creates great domestic hardships and forces the country to
1:57:14
choose between defaulting on its debts and printing a lot of new money.
1:57:20
The country nearly always chooses to print a lot of new money at first
1:57:26
gradually and then massively. This devalues the currency
1:57:31
and raises inflation. typically at those times when the
1:57:37
government has problems funding itself. At the same time as there are bad
1:57:42
financial and economic conditions and large wealth, values and political gaps,
1:57:49
there are great increases in internal conflicts between the rich and the poor
1:57:55
and different ethnic, religious and racial groups. This leads to political extremism that
1:58:03
shows up as populism of the left and populism of the right. Those of the left seek to
1:58:10
redistribute the wealth while those of the right seek to maintain the wealth in
1:58:15
the hands of the rich. This is the anti- capitalist phase when
1:58:21
capitalism, capitalists and the elites in general are blamed for the
1:58:28
problems. Typically during such times, taxes on the rich rise and when the rich
1:58:34
fear their wealth and well-being will be taken away, they move to places, assets,
1:58:40
and currencies they feel safer in. These outflows reduce the country's tax
1:58:46
revenue, which leads to a classic self-reinforcing hollowing out
1:58:53
process. When the flight of wealth gets bad enough, the country outlaws it.
1:58:58
Those seeking to get out begin to panic. The turbulent conditions
1:59:04
undermine productivity, which shrinks the economic pie and causes more conflict about how to divide the
1:59:11
shrinking resources. populist leaders emerge from both sides
1:59:16
and pledge to take control and bring about order. That's when democracy is
1:59:21
most challenged because it fails to control the anarchy and because the move
1:59:27
to a strong populist leader who will bring order to the chaos is most
1:59:34
appealing. As conflict within the country escalates, it leads to some form
1:59:40
of revolution or civil war to redistribute wealth and force the big changes. This can be peaceful and
1:59:47
maintain the existing internal order, but it's more often violent and changes
1:59:53
the order. For example, the Roosevelt revolution to redistribute wealth was
1:59:59
relatively peaceful. While the revolutions that changed the domestic orders in Germany, Japan, Spain, Russia,
2:00:07
and China, which also happened in the 1930s for the same reasons, were much
2:00:13
more violent. These civil wars and revolutions create what I call new
2:00:21
internal orders. I'll explore how internal orders change
2:00:27
in a cyclical way in chapter 5. But the important thing to know for now is that
2:00:34
internal orders can change without leading to a change in the world order.
2:00:40
It's only when the forces that produce internal disorder and
2:00:45
instability align with an external challenge that the entire world order
2:00:51
can change. [Music] Externally, when there is a rising great
2:00:57
power that is capable of challenging the existing great power and the existing
2:01:02
world order, there is a rising risk of great international conflict, especially
2:01:09
if there is internal conflict going on within the existing great power.
2:01:16
Typically, the rising international opponent will seek to exploit this domestic weakness. This is especially
2:01:23
risky if the rising international power has built up a comparable
2:01:29
military. Defending oneself against foreign rivals requires great military
2:01:35
spending, which has to occur even as domestic economic conditions are
2:01:40
deteriorating and the leading great power can least afford it.
2:01:46
Since there is no viable system for peacefully adjudicating international
2:01:52
disputes, these conflicts are typically resolved through tests of power. As bolder challenges are made,
2:02:00
the leading empire is faced with the difficult choice of fighting or retreating.
2:02:06
Fighting and losing are the worst, but retreating is bad, too, because it allows the opposition to progress, and
2:02:14
it shows that one is weak to those other countries that are considering what side
2:02:19
to be on. Poor economic conditions cause more fighting for wealth and power, which
2:02:26
inevitably leads to some kind of a war. Wars are terribly costly. At the
2:02:34
same time, they produce the necessary tectonic shifts that realign the world
2:02:40
order to the new realities of wealth and power. When those holding the reserve
2:02:46
currency and debt of the declining empire lose faith and sell them, that
2:02:52
marks the end of the big cycle. When all of these forces line up,
2:02:59
indebtedness, civil war and revolution at home, war abroad, and the loss of
2:03:05
faith in the currency, a change in the world order is typically at
2:03:11
hand. You could see these forces summarized in their typical progression in the next PDF
2:03:19
chart. I just threw a lot at you. You might want to listen to this again to
2:03:24
see if the sequence makes sense to you. Later we will get into a number of
2:03:30
specific cases in greater depth and you will see the patterns of these cycles
2:03:35
emerge albeit not in a precise way. The fact that they occur and the reasons for
2:03:42
them occurring are less disputable than the exact timing of their
2:03:48
occurrences. To summarize, around the upward trend of
2:03:54
productivity gains that produce rising wealth and better living standards,
2:03:59
there are cycles that produce prosperous periods of building in which the country
2:04:06
is fundamentally strong because there are relatively low levels of
2:04:12
indebtedness, relatively small wealth values and political gaps. People
2:04:18
working effectively together to produce prosperity, good education and
2:04:23
infrastructure, strong and capable leadership, and a peaceful world order
2:04:29
that is guided by one or more dominant world powers. These are the prosperous and
2:04:36
enjoyable periods. When they are taken to excess, which they always are, the
2:04:43
excesses lead to depressing periods of destruction and restructuring in which
2:04:48
the country's fundamental weaknesses of high levels of indebtedness, large
2:04:54
wealth values and political gaps, different factions of people unable to
2:04:59
work well together, poor education and infrastructure, and the struggle to
2:05:05
maintain an overextended empire. fire under the challenge of emerging rivals
2:05:11
lead to a painful period of fighting, destruction, and then a restructuring
2:05:18
that establishes a new water, setting the stage for a new period of
2:05:25
rebuilding. Because these steps unfold in a logical sequence of timeless and
2:05:31
universal cause effect relationships, it is possible to create a health index of
2:05:38
where a country stands by looking at these measures. When the measures are
2:05:44
strong and good, the condition of the country is strong and good and the
2:05:49
period ahead is much more likely to be strong and good. When the ratings of
2:05:54
these items are weak and bad, the conditions of the country are weak and bad and the period ahead is more likely
2:06:02
to be weak and bad. In the next PDF table, to help
2:06:08
paint the picture, I converted most of our measures into colors with dark green
2:06:13
being a very favorable reading and dark red being a very unfavorable reading. It
2:06:20
is the average of these readings that defines which stage of the cycle a country is in in much the same way as it
2:06:28
is the average of the eight readings of power that I used as my measure of total
2:06:34
power. Like those power readings, while one can reconfigure them to produce
2:06:40
marginally different readings, they are broadly indicative in a by and large
2:06:45
way. Here I am showing this to exemplify the typical process not to look at any
2:06:52
specific case. I will however show specific quantitative readings for all
2:06:59
of the major countries later in this book.
2:07:04
Since all of these factors, both ascending and descending, tend to be
2:07:09
mutually reinforcing, it's not a coincidence that large wealth gaps, debt
2:07:17
crises, revolutions, wars, and changes in the world order have tended to come
2:07:22
as a perfect storm. The big cycle of an empire's rise
2:07:28
and decline looks like the next PDF chart.
2:07:33
The bad periods of destruction and restructuring via depression, revolution, and war, which largely tear
2:07:41
down the old system and set the stage for the emergence of a new system,
2:07:47
typically take about 10 to 20 years, though variations in the range can be
2:07:53
much larger. They are depicted in the shaded areas.
2:07:59
They are followed by more extended periods of peace and prosperity in which
2:08:04
smart people work harmoniously together and no country wants to fight the world
2:08:10
power because it's too strong. These peaceful periods last for
2:08:16
about 40 to 80 years though variations in the range can be much larger.
2:08:24
For example, when the Dutch Empire gave way to the British Empire and when the British Empire gave way to the US
2:08:31
Empire, most or all of the following things happened. There was a debt
2:08:37
restructuring and debt crisis. There was an internal revolution, maybe peaceful, maybe
2:08:45
violent, that led to large transfers of wealth from the halves to the have nots.
2:08:52
There was an external war. There were big currency breakdowns. And these things led to a
2:09:01
new domestic and world [Music] order. A preview of where we are now.
2:09:11
As previously explained, the last major period of destroying and restructuring
2:09:17
happened in the 1930 to 45 period, which led to the period of building and the
2:09:25
new world order that began in 1945 with the creation of a new global
2:09:32
monetary system built in 1944 in Bretonwoods, New Hampshire, and a US
2:09:40
dominated system of world governance that located the United Nations in New
2:09:45
York and the World Bank and the IMF in Washington DC. The new world order was the natural
2:09:53
consequence of the US being the richest country in the world. It then had 2/3 of
2:10:00
the world's gold stock and gold was then considered money. And it was the
2:10:06
dominant economic power accounting for about half of world economic production.
2:10:12
And it had the strongest military, virtually a monopoly in nuclear weapons,
2:10:19
and it had the strongest conventional forces. At the time of my writing this
2:10:25
book, it is now 75 years later, and the major old empires, which are also the
2:10:32
major reserve currency empires, are classically approaching the end of a
2:10:37
long-term debt cycle when there are large debts and typical monetary
2:10:43
policies don't work very well. Politically fragmented central
2:10:48
governments have been filling in their financial holes by giving out a lot of
2:10:54
money that they are borrowing while central banks are trying to help by
2:11:00
printing a lot of money. In other words, monetizing government debt.
2:11:05
All of this is happening when there are big wealth and values gaps and a rising
2:11:10
world power that is competing with the existing leading world power in trade,
2:11:16
technology development, capital markets and geopolitics. And on top of this, as of
2:11:24
this writing, we have a pandemic to contend with.
2:11:30
Simultaneously, great human thinking working with computer intelligence is
2:11:35
creating great ways of addressing these challenges. If we can all deal with each
2:11:41
other well, we will certainly get past this difficult time and move on to a new
2:11:47
prosperous period that will be quite different. At the same time, I'm equally
2:11:54
confident that there will be radical changes that will be traumatic for many
2:12:01
people. That is how the world works in a nutshell. That brings us to the end of
