Chapter 4: The Changing Value of Money
0:42
Money. This chapter examines the concepts introduced in the prior chapter in a more granular way to show you how
0:50
consistent they are with the actual cases they are derived from. While we will get a bit more into the mechanics
0:57
here than we did in chapter 3, I have written this chapter in a way that should be accessible to the general
1:03
reader and at the same time precise enough to satisfy the needs of skilled economists and
1:08
investors. As previously explained, there is a real economy and there is a financial economy and the two are
1:15
closely entwined but different. Each has its own supply and demand dynamics. In
1:22
this chapter, we will focus on the supply and demand dynamics of the financial economy to explore what
1:27
determines the value of money. Most people worry about whether their assets are going up or down. They rarely pay
1:34
much attention to the value of their currency. Think about it. How worried are you about your currency declining?
1:41
And how worried are you about how your stocks or your other assets are doing? If you're like most people, you are not
1:48
nearly as aware of your currency risk as you need to be. So, let's explore
1:53
currency risks. All currencies are devalued or
2:00
die. Of the roughly 750 currencies that have existed since 1700, only about 20%
2:07
remain, and all of them have been devalued. If you went back to 1850 as an example,
2:14
the world's major currencies wouldn't look anything like the ones today. While the dollar, pound, and Swiss Frank
2:21
existed in 1850, the most important currencies of that era have died. In
2:27
what is now Germany, you would have used the golden or the dollar. There was no yen, so in Japan, you might have used
2:33
the Coban or the Rio instead. In Italy, you would have used one or more of six
2:40
currencies. You would have used different currencies in Spain, China, and most other countries as well. Some
2:46
were completely wiped out. In most cases, they were in countries that had hyperinflation and/or lost wars and had
2:53
large war debts and replaced by entirely new currencies. Some were merged into
2:59
currencies that replaced them. For example, the individual European currencies were merged into the euro and
3:06
some remain in existence but were devalued like the British pound and the US
3:12
dollar. What do they devalue against? The goal of printing money is
3:18
to reduce debt burdens. So the most important thing for currencies to devalue against is debt. that is
3:25
increase the amount of money relative to the amount of debt to make it easier for debtors to repay. Debt is a promise to
3:32
deliver money. So giving more money to those who need it lessens their debt burden. Where this newly created money
3:39
and credit then flow determines what happens next. In cases in which debt
3:45
relief facilitates the flow of this money and credit into productivity and profits for companies, real stock
3:52
prices, that is the value of stocks after adjusting for inflation, rise.
3:57
When the creation of money sufficiently hurts the actual and prospective returns of cash and debt assets, it drives flows
4:05
out of those assets and into inflation hedge assets like gold, commodities,
4:10
inflation indexed bonds, and other currencies including digital. This leads
4:15
to a self-reinforcing decline in the value of money. At times when the central bank faces the choice between
4:22
allowing real interest rates, that is the rate of interest minus the rate of inflation to rise to the detriment of
4:28
the economy and the anger of most of the public or preventing real interest rates
4:34
from rising by printing money and buying those cash and debt assets. They will
4:39
choose the second path. This reinforces the bad returns of holding cash and
4:44
those debt assets. The later in the long-term debt cycle this happens, the greater the
4:50
likelihood there will be a breakdown in the currency and monetary system. This breakdown is most likely to occur when
4:57
the amounts of debt and money are already too large to be turned into real value for the amounts of goods and
5:03
services they are claims on. The level of real interest rates that is low enough to save debtors from bankruptcy
5:09
is below the level required for creditors to hold the debt as a viable storehold of wealth. and the normal
5:16
central bank levers of allocating capital via interest rate changes which I call monetary policy 1 or MP1 and/or
5:24
printing money and buying highquality debt monetary policy 2 or MP2 don't
5:31
work. This turns monetary policy into a facilitator of a political system that
5:36
allocates resources in an uneconomic way. There are systemically beneficial
5:43
devaluations, though they are always costly to holders of money and debt. And there are systemically destructive ones
5:49
that damage the credit capital allocation system, but are needed to wipe out debt in order to create a new
5:56
monetary order. It's important to be able to tell the difference. To do that, I will start by showing how
6:03
the values of currencies have changed in relation to both gold and consumer price
6:08
index weighted baskets of goods and services. These are relevant comparisons
6:13
because gold is the timeless and universal alternative currency while money is meant to buy goods and
6:19
services. So, its buying power is of paramount importance. I will also touch on how a currency's
6:26
value changes in relation to other currencies and debt and in relation to stocks because they too can be
6:32
storeholds of wealth. The picture that all these measures convey is broadly
6:38
similar when a devaluation is big enough. Many other things, real estate,
6:43
art, etc. are also alternative storeholds of wealth. But gold will make my point
6:50
nicely in relation to gold. The next PDF chart shows spot
6:56
exchange rates of the three major reserve currencies in relation to gold since
7:02
1600. We will examine all of this in depth later. For now, I would like to
7:07
focus on both the spot currency returns and the total returns of interest earning cash in all the major currencies
7:14
since 1850. The next two PDF charts show
7:19
devaluations typically occur fairly abruptly during debt crises that are separated by longer periods of
7:26
prosperity and stability. I noted six devaluations, but of course there were
7:32
many more of minor currencies. To properly compare the returns of holding cash in a currency to
7:39
gold, we have to take into account the interest one would earn on cash. This
7:45
next PDF chart shows the total return, that is price changes plus interest
7:50
earned, on cash in each major currency versus gold. Due to a lack of data,
7:56
several charts in this chapter do not show China. Here are the most notable
8:02
takeaways. Big devaluations are abrupt and episodic rather than
8:08
evolutionary. Over the last 170 years, there were six time frames when really
8:13
big devaluations of major currencies occurred and plenty more of minor
8:18
currencies. In the 1860s during its civil war, the US suspended gold
8:24
convertability and printed paper money known as greenbacks to help monetize war
8:30
debts. Around the time the US returned to its gold peg in the mid 1870s, a
8:36
number of other countries joined the gold standard. Most currencies remained fixed against it until World War I.
8:43
Major exceptions were Japan, which was on a silver linked standard until the 1890s, which led its exchange rate to
8:50
devalue against gold as silver prices fell during this period, and Spain,
8:55
which frequently suspended convertability to support large fiscal deficits. During World War I, waring
9:02
countries ran enormous deficits that were funded by central banks printing and lending of money. Gold served as
9:09
money in foreign transactions as international trust and hence credit was lacking. When the war ended, a new
9:17
monetary order was created with gold and the winning countries currencies which were tied to
9:22
gold. Still, between 1919 and 1922, several European countries, especially
9:28
those that lost the war, were forced to print and devalue their currencies. The
9:33
German mark and German mark debt sank between 1920 and 1923. Some of the winners of the war
9:40
also had debts that had to be devalued to create a new start. With debt, domestic, political,
9:47
and international geopolitical restructurings done. The 1920s boomed,
9:52
particularly in the US, inflating a debt bubble. The debt bubble burst in 1929,
9:59
requiring central banks to print money and devalue it through the 1930s. More money printing and more
10:06
money devaluations were required during World War II to fund military spending. In 1944 and 45, as the war
10:14
ended, a new monetary system that linked the dollar to gold and other currencies to the dollar was created. The
10:22
currencies and debts of Germany, Japan, and Italy, as well as those of China and a number of other countries, were
10:29
quickly and totally destroyed, while those of most winners of the war were slowly but still substantially
10:35
depreciated. This monetary system stayed in place until the late 1960s.
10:41
In 1968-73, most importantly in 1971, excessive spending and debt
10:48
creation, especially by the US, required breaking the dollars linked to gold
10:53
because the claims on gold that were being turned in were far greater than the amount of gold available to redeem
11:00
them. That led to a dollar-based fiat monetary system which allowed the big increase in
11:06
dollar denominated money and credit that fueled the inflation of the 1970s and
11:11
led to the debt crisis of the 1980s. Since 2000, the value of money
11:17
has fallen in relation to the value of gold due to money and credit creation and because interest rates have been low
11:24
in relation to inflation rates. Because the monetary system has been free floating, it hasn't experienced the
11:30
abrupt breaks it did in the past. The devaluation has been more gradual and
11:36
continuous. Low and in some cases negative interest rates have not provided compensation for the increasing
11:43
amount of money and credit and the resulting albeit low inflation. Now, let's take a closer look
11:50
at these events. The returns from holding currencies in short-term debt that collects interest
11:58
were generally profitable between 1850 and 1913 relative to the returns from
12:03
holding gold. Most currencies were able to remain fixed against gold or silver
12:08
and lending and borrowing worked well for those who did it. That prosperous
12:13
period is called the second industrial revolution when borrowers turned the money they borrowed into earnings that
12:20
allowed their debts to be paid back at high interest rates. Times were turbulent nevertheless. For example, in
12:27
the early 1900s in the US, a debt financed speculative boom in stocks grew
12:33
overextended causing a banking and brokerage crisis that led to the panic
12:38
of 1907. At the same time that the large wealth gap and other social issues, for
12:43
example, women's suffrage and trade unionization were causing political tensions. Capitalism was challenged and
12:51
taxes started to rise to fund the wealth redistribution process. Both the Federal
12:56
Reserve and the US federal income tax were instituted in 1913. Though a world away, China was
13:03
impacted by the same dynamic. A stock market bubble led by rubber production stocks. China's equivalent of the
13:10
railroad stock bubbles that contributed to panics in the US throughout the 19th century burst in 1910 causing the crash
13:18
that some have described as a factor in the debt money economic downswing that brought about the end of imperial China.
13:27
But throughout most of that period, type 2 monetary systems, that is those with notes convertible into metal money,
13:34
remained in place in most countries, and the holders of those notes got paid good interest rates without having their
13:40
currencies devalued. The big exceptions were the US devaluation to finance its civil war
13:46
debts in the 1860s, the frequent devaluations of Spain's currency due to
13:51
its weakness as a global power, and the sharp devaluations in Japan's currency due to its remaining on a silver linked
13:59
standard until the 1890s, while silver prices were falling relative to gold.
14:05
Please see the PDF chart for illustration. When World War I began in 1914,
14:12
countries borrowed a lot to fund it. This led to the late debt cycle breakdowns and devaluations that came
14:18
when war debts had to be wiped out, effectively destroying the monetary systems of the war's losers.
14:25
The Paris Peace Conference that ended the war in 1918 attempted to institute a
14:31
new international order around the League of Nations. But those efforts at cooperation could not forstall the debt
14:37
crises and monetary instability caused by the huge war indemnities that were
14:42
placed on the defeated powers as well as the large war debts that the victorious
14:48
Allied powers owed each other, particularly the US. Germany suffered a complete wipeout of
14:55
the value of money and credit which led to the most iconic hyperinflation in history during the VHimar Republic which
15:01
I describe in great detail in principles for navigating big debt crises. The Spanish flu pandemic also
15:09
occurred during the period beginning in 1918 and ending in 1920. With the
15:14
exception of the US, virtually every country devalued its currency because they had to monetize some of their war
15:21
debts. Had they not done so, they wouldn't have been able to compete in world markets with the countries that
15:27
did. China's silver-based currency rallied sharply relative to gold and
15:32
gold linked currencies near the end of the war as silver prices rose and then
15:37
mechanically devalued as silver prices fell sharply amid the post-war deflation in the US. That period of war and
15:45
devaluation that established the new world order in 1918 was followed by an
15:51
extended and productive period of economic prosperity particularly in the US known as the roaring 20s. Like all
15:59
such periods, it led to big debt and asset bubbles and large wealth gaps.
16:05
Please see the PDF charts for illustration. Different versions of the same thing
16:11
happened during the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1933, a global
16:16
debt crisis caused economic contractions that led to money printing and competitive devaluations in virtually
16:23
every country, eroding the value of money moving into World War II. Conflicts over wealth within
16:30
countries led to greater conflicts between them. All the waring countries built up war debts while the US gained a
16:37
lot of wealth in the form of gold during the war. Then after the war, the value
16:42
of money and debt was completely wiped out for the losers, Germany, Japan, and Italy, as well as for China and was
16:50
severely devalued for the UK and France, even though they were among the winners.
16:55
A new world order and a period of prosperity followed the war. We won't
17:00
examine it other than to mention that the excessive borrowing that took place set in motion the next big devaluation
17:06
which happened between 1968 and 1973. See the PDF chart for
17:14
illustration. By the mid1 1950s, the dollar and the Swiss Frank were the only currencies worth even half of their
17:20
1850s exchange rate. As seen in the next related PDF chart, the downward pressure
17:27
on currencies and upward pressure on gold started in 1968. On August 15th, 1971, President
17:35
Nixon ended the Bretonwoods monetary system, devaluing the dollar and leaving
17:40
the monetary system in which the dollar was backed by gold and instituting a fiat monetary system. I will cover this
17:47
episode in more detail in chapter 11. Since 2000, we have seen a more gradual
17:54
and orderly loss of total return in currencies when measured in gold, consistent with the broad fall in real
18:00
rates across countries. In summary, the average annual return of interest earning cash
18:07
currency between 1850 and the present was 1.2% which was a bit higher than the
18:13
average real return of holding gold, which was 0.9%. Though there were huge differences in
18:19
returns at various periods of time and in various countries, you would have received a
18:25
positive real return for holding bills in about half of the countries during that time period and a negative real
18:31
return in the other half. In the case of Germany, you would have been totally wiped out twice.
18:38
Most of the real returns from holding interest earning cash currency would have come in the periods of prosperity
18:44
when most countries were on gold standards that they adhered to. For example, during the second industrial
18:50
revolution when debt levels and debt service burdens were relatively low and
18:55
income growth was nearly equal to debt growth. The real return for bills since
19:01
1912, the modern fiat era, has been 0.1%.
19:07
The real return of gold during this era has been 1.6%. You would only have made a
19:13
positive real return holding interest earning cash currency in about half of the countries during this era and you
19:19
would have lost meaningfully in the rest over 2% a year in France, Italy and
19:25
Japan and over 18% a year in Germany due to the hyperinflation.
19:30
Please see the next PDF which shows currency and gold real returns of major
19:35
countries since 1850. The next PDF chart shows the real
19:41
returns from holding gold between 1850 and the present. From 1850 to 1971, gold
19:48
returned through its appreciation an amount that roughly equaled the amount of money lost to inflation on average.
19:55
Though there were big variations around that average both across countries, for example, Germany seeing large gold
20:02
outperformance while countries with only limited devaluations like the US saw gold prices not keep up with inflation.
20:09
And across time, for example, the 1930s currency devaluations and the World War
20:15
II era devaluations of money that were part of the formation of the Bretonwoods monetary system in 1944.
20:22
After the war, gold stayed steady in price across most countries, while money
20:27
and credit expanded until 1971. Then in 1971, there was a shift
20:33
from a type 2 monetary system, notes backed by gold, to a type three fiat
20:39
monetary system. That dellinking of currencies from gold gave central banks
20:44
the unconstrained ability to create money and credit. That led to high inflation and low real interest rates
20:51
which led to the big appreciation in the real gold price until 1980 and 81 when
20:57
interest rates were raised significantly above the inflation rate leading currencies to strengthen and gold to
21:04
fall until 2000. That is when central banks pushed interest rates down relative to
21:10
inflation rates and when they couldn't push rates any lower by normal means printed money and bought financial
21:16
assets which supported gold prices. Please see the next PDF
21:23
graphic. The value of currencies in relation to goods and services. Thus far we have looked at the
21:31
market values of currencies in relation to the market value of gold. That raises the question as to whether gold is an
21:38
appropriate gauge of value. The next PDF chart shows the value of interest earning currency in
21:44
terms of the consumer price index CPI baskets of goods and services in those
21:50
currencies reflecting their changes in buying power. As can be clearly seen,
21:55
the two world wars were very bad and there have been ups and downs in the years since. For about half of the
22:02
currencies, interest earning cash provided a return above the rate of inflation. For the other half, it
22:07
provided negative real returns. In all cases, there were big and roughly 10-year long swings around those
22:15
averages. In other words, history has shown that there are very large risks in
22:20
holding interesting cash currency as a storehold of wealth, especially late in
22:25
debt cycles. Please see the next PDF graphic. [Music]
22:31
The patterns of countries devaluing and losing their reserve currency
22:37
status. A currency devaluing and a currency losing its reserve currency status aren't necessarily the same,
22:44
though both are caused by debt crisis. The loss of reserve currency status is a
22:49
product of chronic large devaluations. As previously explained, increasing the
22:55
supply of money and credit reduces the value of money and credit. This is bad for holders of money and credit, but a
23:02
relief to debtors. When this debt relief allows money and credit to flow into
23:07
productivity and profits for companies, real stock prices rise. But it can also
23:13
damage the actual and prospective returns of cash and debt assets enough to drive people out of them and into
23:20
inflation hedge assets and other currencies. The central bank then prints money and buys cash and debt assets
23:27
which reinforces the bad returns of holding them. The later in the long-term debt cycle this happens, the greater the
23:34
likelihood that there will be a breakdown in the currency and monetary system. Policymakers and investors must
23:41
be able to tell the difference between systemically beneficial devaluations and systemically destructive
23:48
ones. What do these devaluations have in common? All the economies in the major
23:54
cases that we examine in depth in part two experienced a classic run dynamic in
24:00
which there were more claims on the central bank than there was hard currency available to satisfy them. That
24:06
hard currency was typically gold, though it was US dollars for the UK reserve currency decline because at that time
24:13
the pound was linked to the dollar. Net central bank reserves start
24:18
falling prior to the actual devaluation. In some cases years ahead also worth noting that in several
24:25
cases countries suspended convertability before the actual devaluation of the exchange rate. The UK did this in 1947
24:34
and ahead of the 1949 devaluation and the US did it in
24:39
1971. The run on the currency and the devaluations typically occur alongside
24:45
significant debt problems often related to wartime spending. For example, the fourth Anglo Dutch war for the
24:51
Netherlands, the world wars for the UK and the Vietnam War for the US which put
24:57
pressure on the central bank to print. The worst situations are when countries lose wars. That typically leads to the
25:04
total collapse and restructuring of their currencies and their economies. However, winners of wars that end up
25:10
with debts much larger than their assets and reduced competitiveness, for example, the UK after the World Wars,
25:17
also lose their reserve currency status, though more gradually.
25:22
Typically, central banks initially respond by letting short-term rates rise, but that is too economically
25:29
painful. So, they quickly capitulate and increase the supply of money. After the money devalues, they typically cut
25:37
rates. Outcomes diverge significantly across the cases with a key variable
25:42
being how much economic and military power the country retains at the time of the devaluation.
25:48
The more it has, the more willing savers are to continue holding their money there. More specifically for the major
25:55
reserve currencies. For the Dutch, the collapse of the gilder was massive and relatively
26:01
quick. It took place over less than a decade with the actual circulation of gilders falling swiftly by the end of
26:08
the fourth Anglo Dutch War in 1784. The collapse came as the Netherlands
26:13
entered a steep decline as a world power. First losing to the British and subsequently facing invasion from
26:20
France. For the UK, the decline was more gradual. It took two devaluations before
26:25
it fully lost its reserve currency status after Breton Woods. Though it experienced periodic balance of payment
26:32
strains over the intervening period, many who held reserves in pounds continued to do so because of political
26:39
pressures and their assets significantly underperformed US assets during the same
26:44
time. In the case of the US, there were two big abrupt devaluations in 1933 and
26:51
1971 and more gradual devaluations against gold since 2000. but they
26:57
haven't cost the US its reserve currency status. Typically, a country loses its
27:02
reserve currency status when there is an already established loss of economic and political primacy to a rising rival
27:09
which creates a vulnerability. For example, the Netherlands falling behind the UK or the UK falling behind the US
27:17
and there are large and growing debts monetized by the central bank printing money and buying government debt. This
27:24
leads to a weakening of the currency in a self-reinforcing run that can't be stopped because the fiscal and balance
27:30
of payments deficits are too great for any cutbacks to close. In part two, we will see the last
27:39
500 years of history as one continuous story of rises and declines of empires
27:44
and the reasons for them. And you will see the same cause effect relationships driving the rises and declines. But
27:51
first we need to explore the big cycles of internal and external order disorder
27:57
which we will do in the next two chapters. Chapter 5. The big cycle of
Chapter 5: The Big Cycle of Internal Order and Disorder
28:04
internal order and disorder. How people are with each other
28:10
is the primary driver of the outcomes they get within countries. There are systems or orders for governing how
28:17
people are supposed to behave with each other. These systems and the actual behaviors of people operating within
28:23
them produce consequences. In this chapter, we will explore the timeless and universal cause effect relationships
28:31
that shape the internal orders and the behaviors that drive the shifts between periods of order and periods of
28:37
disorder. Through my research, I saw how changes in internal orders, that is count's
28:44
systems for governing internally and changes in the world order, that is the systems determining power between
28:51
countries, happen continuously and everywhere in similar and increasingly
28:56
interconnected ways that flow together as one all-encompassing story from the beginning of recorded time up to this
29:03
moment. Seeing many interlinking cases evolve together helped me to discover the
29:10
patterns that govern them and to imagine the future based on what I've learned.
29:15
Most importantly, I saw how the constant struggle for wealth and power produced continuously evolving internal systems
29:22
and orders and external systems and orders and saw how these internal and
29:27
external orders affect each other with the whole thing that is the world order
29:32
working like a perpetual motion machine that evolves while doing the same things over and over again for basically the
29:39
same reasons. The biggest thing affecting most people in most countries through time is how
29:45
people struggle to make, take, and distribute wealth and power, though they also struggle over other things, most
29:52
importantly, ideology and religion. I saw how these struggles happened in
29:58
timeless and universal ways and how these struggles had huge implications for all aspects of people's lives.
30:05
Starting with what happened with taxes, the economy, and how people were with each other through periods of boom and
30:11
bust and peace and war, and how they unfolded in cyclical ways like the tide
30:16
coming in and out. I saw that when these struggles took the form of healthy competition that
30:23
encouraged human energy to be put into productive activities, they produced productive internal orders and
30:29
prosperous times. And when those energies took the form of destructive internal fighting, they produced
30:35
internal disorder and painfully difficult times. I saw why the swings
30:41
between productive order and destructive disorder typically evolved in cycles
30:46
driven by logical cause effect relationships and how they happened in all countries for mostly the same
30:52
reasons. I saw that those that rose to achieve greatness did so because of a confluence of key forces coming together
31:00
to produce that greatness and those that declined did so because these forces
31:06
dissipated. At the time of this writing, there is growing disorder in a number of leading countries around the world, most
31:13
importantly in the United States. I wanted to put that disorder into perspective. So, I built indices of it
31:20
and conducted the research I am sharing in this chapter because how the US handles its disorder will have profound
31:27
implications for Americans, others around the world, and most economies and markets. In this chapter, I am focusing
31:35
more on the US than on other countries. The PDF of this simplified
31:40
chart shows approximately where the US and China are within the archetypical
31:45
big cycle as measured by the previously described determinance. The US is in the
31:51
stage which I call stage 5 when there are bad financial conditions and intensifying conflict. At the same time,
31:59
the leading empire still has other great strengths. for example, technology and military that are declining on a
32:06
relative basis. Classically, this stage comes after periods of great excesses
32:12
and spending and debt and the widening of wealth and political gaps and before
32:17
there are revolutions and civil wars. To be clear, I am not saying that
32:22
the United States or other countries are inevitably headed into a period of greater decline or more internal and
32:28
external conflict. However, I am saying that it is important to watch the
32:34
markers in order to understand both what is happening and the full range of possibilities for the period ahead. In
32:41
this chapter, I explore those markers by drawing on the lessons from analogous historical
32:46
[Music] cases. The six stages of the internal cycle.
32:53
Internal orders typically, though not always, change through a relatively standard sequence of stages, like the
33:00
progression of a disease. By looking at their symptoms, we can tell which stages
33:05
countries are in. For example, just as stage three cancer is different from stage 4 cancer in ways defined by
33:12
different conditions that exist and have come about as a result of things that happened in prior stages. The same is
33:18
true for the different stages of the big internal cycle. Like diseases, different
33:23
conditions warrant different actions to address them and they produce a different range of probabilities that
33:29
those actions will lead to. For example, an old unhealthy set of circumstances
33:35
produces a range of possibilities and warrants different actions than a young healthy set. As with cancer, it is best
33:42
to stop the progress before getting into the later stages. From studying history, it appears to me
33:49
that the stages of the archetypical cycle from internal order to internal disorder and back are as follows.
33:58
Stage one, when the new order begins and the new leadership consolidates power,
34:04
which leads to stage two, when the resource allocation systems and government bureaucracies are built and
34:10
refined, which if done well, leads to stage three, when there is peace and
34:16
prosperity, which leads to stage four, when there are great excesses in spending and debt, and the widening of
34:23
wealth and political gaps, which leads to stage Five, when there are very bad
34:29
financial conditions and intense conflict, which leads to stage six, when
34:35
there are civil wars, revolutions, which leads to stage one, which leads to stage
34:41
two, etc., with the whole cycle happening over again. Each stage presents a different
34:48
set of conditions that the people facing them have to deal with. Some of these circumstances are much more difficult
34:55
than others to resolve. For example, early in the long-term debt cycle when there's plenty of capacity for
35:01
governments to create debt to finance spending, it is easier to deal with the circumstances at hand than late in the
35:08
long-term debt cycle when there is little or no capacity to create money and credit to finance spending. For
35:14
these reasons, the range of possible paths forward and the challenges that leaders face depend on where in the
35:21
cycle a country is. These different stages present different challenges that require different qualities,
35:27
understandings, and skills from leaders in order to effectively deal with them.
35:32
To get a rich picture of what makes great leaders great in different types of circumstances, I recommend Henry
35:39
Kissinger's forthcoming book on leadership. How well those facing these
35:45
circumstances, for example, you facing your circumstances and our leaders facing our collective circumstances,
35:52
understand and adapt to them, affects how good or bad the outcomes will be within the range of possibilities that
35:59
exist given the circumstances. Different cultures have established different ways of
36:04
approaching these circumstances. Those leaders and cultures who understand them and can adapt to their circumstances
36:11
will produce much better outcomes than those who don't. That is where timeless and universal principles come in. While
36:19
the length of time spent in each of these stages can vary a lot, the evolution through them generally takes
36:26
100 years, give or take a lot, and with big undulations within the cycle. Like
36:32
evolution in general, the evolution of internal orders occurs in a cyclical way in which one stage typically leads to
36:39
the next through a progression of stages that repeat and in the process evolve to higher levels of development. For
36:46
example, stage one when the new internal order is created by new leaders who came
36:52
to power via a civil war or revolution normally comes after stage six when
36:57
there is a civil war or revolution which is the low point in the cycle which leads to the next stage and so on up to
37:04
stage three which is the high point in the cycle because there is a lot of peace and prosperity in that stage which
37:11
gets overdone in stages four and five and so on leading to the next new order stage one that happens over and over
37:19
again in an upward evolving way. Again, that archetypical cycle typically takes
37:25
100 years, give or take a lot. Within each cycle, there are similar smaller
37:30
cycles. For example, there is a short-term debt cycle that leads to bubbles and recessions that come along
37:36
roughly every 8 years. There are political cycles that move political control between the right and the left
37:43
that come along with roughly equal frequency etc. Every country is now
37:48
going through them and many of them are in different stages. For example, China and India are in very different stages
37:55
than the United States and most European countries. Which stages countries are in
38:01
versus other countries affects the relations between countries and is the primary determinant of the world order.
38:08
We will explore all of this in the last chapter of this book. The cycle's archetypical evolution transpires as
38:15
shown in the next PDF diagram. That is the complete internal
38:20
order cycle. But of course, the cycle repeats with new leaders replacing the old ones and the whole cycle beginning
38:27
again. How quickly a nation is able to rebuild and achieve new heights of prosperity
38:33
depends on one how severe the civil war or revolution that ended the prior cycle
38:39
was and two how competent the leaders of the new cycle are at establishing the
38:44
things required for success. These cycles have taken place for as long as there has been recorded
38:50
history and probably before. So many cycles are linked together and they are
38:56
upward sloping because of the evolutionary gains that are made over time. This is illustrated in the next
39:03
PDF diagram. To see this at the country level, let's look at China. The next PDF
39:10
chart shows my estimates of China's absolute powers and its figurative big
39:15
cycles going back to around the year 600. This is an ultraimplified chart
39:21
that is there were many more dynasties and complexities. I am presenting it in
39:26
this way so you can see how this evolution transpired from the 30,000 ft
39:32
level. The next PDF chart shows China's relative powers. The differences between
39:38
the charts are due to the fact that the first one shows the absolute level of power while the second one shows the
39:44
level of power relative to other empires. Since different countries are typically
39:50
in different stages of the cycle and since they take wealth and global political power from each other, some
39:57
countries are rising while others are declining. So the whole is less volatile than any one country. In other words,
40:04
the differences have had a diversifying effect that has made the whole world's evolution smoother than that of any
40:11
individual country. that is shown in the next PDF chart which is an update to the
40:16
global real GDP chart I showed you in chapter 1. This chart is not a
40:22
figurative representation. It is literally the best estimate we have of real GDP per capita. Embedded in this
40:29
chart are the rises and falls of major empires particularly the Dutch and the British empires and the Ming andQing
40:36
dynasties. numerous wars and numerous booms and busts, all of which are called
40:42
out. These events don't show up at the global level because they diversify each
40:47
other and because they are small relative to the big trends, even though they are huge from the perspective of
40:53
the people living through them. To reiterate, the figurative pictures of the archetypical six-stage
41:00
cycle I just painted are simplified versions of what really happens. I
41:05
wanted to show you a simplified version that conveys the essence of the stages and then descend into the details. While
41:13
the cycle by and large progresses as I described, it doesn't always progress exactly as I described. For example,
41:20
like the stages of a disease, let's say stage 3 cancer, being in one stage doesn't mean that the progression to the
41:27
next stage is inevitable. But it does tell us a lot that is very valuable. As with a
41:33
disease, certain symptoms are clearly exhibited that allow one to identify which stage in the cycle one is in. And
41:40
being in that stage signifies the risks and ways of treating the situation that are essential to know and are different
41:46
from those that exist in different stages. For example, being in stage 5 means that certain conditions exist and
41:53
make it more likely that the cycle will progress to stage six than if it were in stage 4 with stage 4
41:59
conditions. By having clear and objective markers to identify which stage each country or state or city is
42:06
in, and by having an understanding of the cause effect relationships that produce changes, one can better know the
42:12
range of possibilities and position oneself accordingly, though one can never get them exactly right.
42:20
As an example, we made an index of the number of economic red flags that have existed at different times in history,
42:26
including measures of high inequality, high debt and deficits, inflation, and bad growth to show how indicative they
42:33
are of subsequent civil wars and revolutions. The next PDF chart shows
42:39
the estimated likelihood of a civil war type conflict based on the number of red flags. Based on what we have seen in the
42:46
past, we estimate that when there are 60 to 80% of the red flags present, there
42:51
is around a 1 in6 chance of severe internal conflict. When lots of these
42:56
conditions are in place, greater than 80%, there is around a 1 in3 chance of a
43:02
civil war or revolution. So, not very probable, but still too probable for
43:07
comfort. The US is in the 60 to 80% bucket today.
43:13
This chart is based on historical analysis of nine great powers covering
43:18
about 2200 years of history in total. The likelihood of conflict is based on
43:23
major cases of civil war, rebellion, and revolution, but excludes peaceful revolutions that did not change the
43:30
existing system. The analysis does not count the probability of conflict arising in a period when a country is
43:36
already in the midst of internal conflict and the 5 years following. to avoid counting periods in which economic
43:43
conditions were bad because of the conflict itself. While I won't take you through
43:49
all of the factors in each stage and their various configurations, I will outline the forces and milestones to pay
43:56
most attention to in each stage with a special emphasis on the current state of disorder in the United States and how
44:02
things are progressing. Delving into the six stages of the
44:09
cycle. We will now delve into what the archetypical six stages look like in
44:14
greater detail so we can identify them easily when we see them and so we can better imagine what might come
44:21
next. Stage one, when the new order begins and the new leadership
44:26
consolidates power. To fight a civil war or to have a revolution, even a peaceful one, is to
44:34
have a great conflict in which one side wins and the other side loses and the country suffers damages. Stage one is
44:42
what follows the war. It is a time when the winners gain control and the losers must submit. While the winners were
44:49
strong enough to win at this first stage of the new order, they must also be wise enough to consolidate power and rebuild
44:57
the country. After winning power, the new leaders typically mop up the remaining opposition and fight among
45:03
themselves for power. In fact, one might say that revolutions typically come in two parts. The first part is the fight
45:10
to bring down the established leaders and systems and the second part is the fight to remove those who were loyal to
45:16
the former leaders and the fight for power among those who won. I will call the second part purges and touch on them
45:24
in this section. These consolidation of power purge periods range widely in form and
45:32
severity depending on the degrees of conflict between the new leaders and their opposition, the amount of conflict
45:38
between the new leaders themselves and the levels of development of the various government departments and bureaucracies
45:45
that they are inheriting. This is the stage when in some cases the remaining opposition is killed or imprisoned so
45:52
that the new leaders are assured that their enemies won't come back fighting. It is also when those revolutionaries
45:59
who were on the winning side of the revolution fight against each other for power. This stage has happened after
46:05
virtually all civil wars and revolutions. Its intensity varies usually in proportion to the intensity
46:11
of the civil war or revolution that preceded this stage. At its worst, this
46:16
postrevolution fighting to consolidate power produced some of the most brutal periods in a given country's history.
46:23
For example, the post 1789 French Revolution period called the reign of terror, the post 1917 Russian revolution
46:31
period called the red terror, the post 1949 Chinese civil war period called the
46:37
anti-rightest campaign, etc. In some cases, these purges happened a single
46:42
time right after the revolution. for example, the reign of terror. While in other cases, they came and went
46:49
episodically over decades. For example, China's cultural revolution happened 17
46:54
years after the Chinese Communist Party came to power. These purges are done to
46:59
consolidate power and persecute perceived ideological enemies or enemies of the state. And they are sometimes
47:06
more brutal than the revolution itself. at their best and if conditions allow
47:11
because the basic system and respect for it is maintained. They're like the period after the US Civil War or during
47:18
the peaceful Roosevelt Revolution of the 1930s. During this stage, the leaders
47:24
who do best are consolidators of power. They typically have qualities similar to
47:29
those who did best in the revolution in the prior stage as they are strong, smart fighters who are willing and able
47:36
to win at all costs. But in this stage, they have to be much more politically
47:41
astute because the enemies are much less apparent. Tang Emperor Taong and Rome's
47:47
Caesar Augustus excelled at this stage. More recently, leaders such as the US
47:53
founding fathers, France's Napoleon, and Germany's Ottovon Bismar also exemplify
47:59
how to effectively move from the war period to the rebuilding period. This
48:05
stage is over when the new authorities are clear and everyone is sick of the fighting and is well into the
48:13
rebuilding. Stage two, when resource allocation systems and government bureaucracies are built and
48:21
refined. I call this phase early prosperity because it is typically the beginning of a peaceful and prosperous
48:28
period. After the new leaders have torn down the old order and consolidated power or overlapping with that time, the
48:36
new leaders have to start building a new system to better allocate resources. This is the stage when system and
48:42
institution building are of paramount importance. What is required is designing and creating a system order
48:50
that leads to people rowing in the same direction in pursuit of similar goals with respect for rules and laws and
48:57
putting together an effective resource allocation system that leads to rapidly improving productivity that benefits
49:04
most people. This redesigning and rebuilding period has to be done even
49:09
after lost wars because rebuilding still must occur. Examples of countries being
49:15
in this stage include the United States in the 15 years after it declared independence in
49:20
1776. The early Napoleonic era immediately after Napoleon grabbed power in a coup at the end of the French
49:27
Revolution in 1799. The early Japanese Maji restoration period immediately after the
49:33
political revolution in 1868. the post-war periods in Japan,
49:39
Germany, and most countries in the late 1940s through most of the 1950s, the
49:44
post civil war period in China and Russia after the break up of the Soviet Union. A timeless and universal
49:51
principle to keep in mind during this stage is that to be successful, the system has to produce prosperity for
49:58
most people, especially the large middle class. As Aristotle conveyed in
50:04
politics, those states are likely to be well administered in which the middle class is large and stronger, if
50:12
possible, than both the other classes. Where the middle class is large, there are least likely to be factions and
50:19
dissensions. For when there is no middle class and the poor are excessive in number, troubles arise and the state
50:26
soon comes to an end. The leaders who are best during this stage are typically very different from
50:33
those who succeeded in stages six and one. I call them civil engineers. While
50:39
they need to be smart and ideally they are still strong and inspirational, above all else, they need to be able to
50:46
design and build the system that is productive for most people or they need to have people working for them who can
50:52
do that. The different qualities of leaders that are required to succeed in the revolutionary stages 6 and 1 and
51:00
those that are required in this rebuilding administrative stage two are exemplified by Winston Churchill and Mao
51:07
being great inspirational generals and lousy civil engineers.
51:12
Examples of great leaders at this stage include Conrad Adenau in Germany, Lie
51:17
Kuan Yu in Singapore, and Dong Xiaoing in China, who came to power after wars
51:23
and built systems that produced prosperity well beyond their lifetimes.
51:28
The most extraordinary leaders are those who took their countries through stages 6 1 and two. That is through the civil
51:36
war, revolution, through the consolidation of power and through the building of the institutions and systems
51:42
that worked fabulously for a long time after them and did it at scale. The best
51:48
ever probably were Tang Taong, one of the revolutionary founders of the Tang Dynasty in China in the 600s, which was
51:56
followed by about a century and a half of peace and prosperity that led China to become the world's largest and
52:02
strongest country. Caesar Augustus, who became the first emperor of Rome in 27
52:08
B.CE CE and began roughly 200 years of relative peace and prosperity in which
52:14
Rome became the world's largest empire and Genghask Khan who founded and led
52:19
the Mongol Empire starting in 1206 which was followed by over a century of
52:24
prosperity when it became the world's largest and strongest empire. Though failure to establish a sustainable
52:31
succession produced civil wars, including shortly after his death.
52:37
This sequence of rebuilding happens all the time in varying degrees depending on the amount of change that is warranted.
52:44
In some cases, it comes after brutal revolutions when there needs to be a rebuilding of nearly everything. And in
52:51
other cases, it comes when the institutions and systems that are there just need to be modified to suit the new
52:58
leader. Stage three, when there is peace and
53:04
prosperity. I also call this phase mid prosperity. It is the sweet spot of the
53:10
internal order cycle. It is when people have an abundance of opportunity to be productive, are excited about it, work
53:17
well together, produce a lot, get rich, and are admired for being successful. In
53:22
this stage, conditions are improving for almost everyone. So most of the next generation is better off than most of
53:29
the prior generation. So there is broad optimism and excitement about the future. History shows us that when done
53:36
well, there is wide and almost equal access to education and merit-based placements and jobs. This draws on the
53:44
widest possible range of the population to access talent and yields a system that most people believe is fair.
53:51
Successful entrepreneurs, inventors, and adventurers produce new ideas and take
53:56
their societies to new places and become the heroes who others aspire to be like because of how they come up with
54:03
revolutionary new ideas, make people's lives better, and are rewarded for it.
54:09
Debt growth fuels productivity and in turn real income growth, which makes
54:14
debts easy to service and provides excess profits that make equity returns excellent. Incomes exceed expenses and
54:22
savings exceed liabilities with the savings financing investment in the future. Stage three is an exciting
54:29
period that has a lot of creativity, productivity, and energy. Examples of this period include
54:36
most of the Victorian era in Britain, covering much of the 19th century, marked by second industrial revolution
54:42
inventions producing a rapid increase in prosperity. the German Empire in the
54:47
late 1800s with rapid industrialization, technological innovation, and a quickly
54:53
strengthening military and the 1960s in the United States. For example, the
54:58
moonshot project exemplified the shared mission. The whole country cheered and
55:04
was brought closer together when the lunar landing happened. This is the time for the inspirational
55:10
visionary who can a imagine and convey an exciting picture of a future that
55:16
never existed before. B actually build that future out and then c use the
55:22
prosperity earned to broaden the inclusiveness of it and to invest in the future.
55:28
They do this while d maintaining sound finances and e pursuing excellent
55:34
international relations so that they protect or expand their empires without any financially or socially debilitating
55:40
wars. Examples include in the British Empire's Victorian age in the mid to
55:46
late 1800s, Prime Minister William Gladstone simultaneously maintained high levels of productivity, imposed strict
55:53
budget controls that led to strong finances, and supported the general population so much that he was known as
56:00
the people's William. He also ran a peaceful and prosperous foreign policy.
56:06
In the German Empire in the late 1800s, Chancellor Otto von Bismar united the
56:11
disperate populations of 39 different states and people of different religions to build Germany as a country and an
56:19
economic powerhouse. Under him, Germany had an economic boom with sound finances while
56:25
brilliantly navigating international relations so it benefited internally and avoided debilitating major wars.
56:33
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yu successfully took Singapore through these stages by running the country as Prime Minister
56:40
from 1959 to 1990 and mentoring until his death in
56:45
2015. He created the principles and shaped the culture to be successful long after him and avoided wars without
56:53
losing power. In the postwar US, John F. Kennedy and his 34 short months as
56:59
president from January 20th, 1961 to November 22nd, 1963 inspired the country to go to the
57:07
moon, advanced the civil rights movement, undertook the war on poverty with Vice President Lyndon Johnson, and
57:14
kept the United States out of major wars while simultaneously strongly containing opposition to the US Empire.
57:22
In China, Deng Xiaoping transitioned a weak and inefficient communist system to
57:28
a highly productive state capitalist system, quickly changing the nation's psychology to make these changes with
57:34
sayings such as, "It is glorious to be rich," and "It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white as long as it
57:42
catches mice." Built China's economy and finances to be very strong. Enormously
57:48
improved the education and quality of life of most people. dramatically increased life expecties and reduced
57:54
poverty rates, successfully led China through internal political conflicts, and strictly maintained China's
58:01
sovereignty while avoiding major external conflicts. The longer countries stay in
58:08
this stage, the longer their good times last. During this stage, the developments to
58:14
pay attention to that reflect the big risks that naturally develop and undermine the self- sustaining good
58:20
results are the widenings of the opportunity, income, wealth, and value
58:26
gaps accompanied by bad and unfair conditions for the majority, luxurious
58:31
and unfairly privileged positions for the elites, declining productivity, and
58:36
bad finances in which excess debts are created. The great empires and great
58:42
dynasties that were able to sustain themselves stayed in stage three by avoiding these risks. The failure to
58:50
avoid these risks leads to stage four which is a period of excesses. This is
58:55
the stage in which the temptation to do everything and borrow money to do it can
59:00
lead to the brink of conflict. Stage four, a period of
59:07
excesses. I also call this the bubble prosperity phase. I will describe it briefly
59:13
because we touched on these elements before. Classically, there is the
59:19
rapidly increasing debt financed purchases of goods, services, and investment assets. So, debt growth
59:25
outpaces the capacity of future cash flows to service the debts. So, bubbles
59:30
are created. These debt financed purchases emerge because investors, business leaders, financial
59:36
intermediaries, individuals, and policy makers tend to assume that the future will be like the past. So they bet
59:43
heavily on the trends continuing. They mistakenly believe that investments that have gone up a lot are good rather than
59:50
expensive. So they borrow money to buy them, which drives up their prices, which reinforces this bubble process.
59:57
That is because as their assets go up in value, their net worth and spending to income level rise, which increases their
1:00:04
borrowing capacity, which supports the leveraging up process and so the spiral goes until the bubbles burst. Japan in
1:00:12
1988 to 90, the US in 1929, the US in 2006 and07, and Brazil and most other
1:00:19
Latin American commodity producers in 1977 to79 are classic examples.
1:00:26
There is a shift in the spending of money and time to more on consumption and luxury goods and less on profitable
1:00:33
investments. The reduced level of investments in infrastructure, capital goods and R&D slows the country's
1:00:40
productivity gains and leads its cities and infrastructure to become older and less
1:00:45
efficient. There is a lot of spending on the military at this stage to expand and protect global interests, especially if
1:00:52
the country is a leading global power. the country's balance of payments
1:00:57
positions deteriorate reflecting its increased borrowing and reduced competitiveness. If the country is a
1:01:04
reserve currency country, this borrowing is made easy as the result of non-reserve currency country savers
1:01:10
having a preference to save in or lend to the reserve currency. Wealth and opportunity gaps
1:01:17
are large and resentments between classes emerge. During this phase, the
1:01:23
archetypical best leader is the well-grounded, disciplined leader who understands and conveys sound
1:01:28
fundamental behaviors that yield productivity and sound finances and creates restraints when the crowd wants
1:01:35
to overdo things. These leaders are the ones who lead the country to continue to reinvest a significant amount of their
1:01:41
earnings and their time into being productive when they become richer. As mentioned, Lee Kuan Yu, the former prime
1:01:49
minister of Singapore, ensured that his country and fellow citizens had the culture to become well- educated,
1:01:55
disciplined, and of strong character even after becoming successful and rich.
1:02:00
However, these leaders are few and far between because fighting the abansions of the masses is very unpopular.
1:02:08
In almost all cases, after becoming rich, the country and its leaders become decadent, overspend, borrow to finance
1:02:15
excess consumption, and lose competitiveness. This period of decline is exemplified by decadent leaders such
1:02:23
as the notorious Emperor Nero, who used a city-wide fire in Rome to confiscate
1:02:28
land to build an expansive palace. Louis I 14th who expanded the palace of
1:02:33
Versailles while productivity fell and people endured hardships at the height of his power and the Ming dynasty's Wii
1:02:40
emperor who withdrew from actively governing and focused on the construction of his own immense
1:02:47
[Music] tomb. Stage five when there are bad financial conditions and intense
1:02:54
conflict. The most important influence that transpires in a big cycle is that
1:02:59
of debt, money, and economic activity. Because I covered that cycle comprehensively in chapters 3 and four,
1:03:06
I won't explain it here in detail. But to understand stage five, you need to
1:03:11
know that it follows stage three in which there is peace and prosperity and favorable debt and credit conditions and
1:03:18
stage four in which excess and decadence begin to bring about worse conditions.
1:03:24
This process culminates in the most difficult and painful stage, stage six,
1:03:29
when the entity runs out of money and there is typically terrible conflict in the form of revolution or civil war.
1:03:36
Stage five is the period during which the interclass tensions that go along with worsening financial conditions come
1:03:42
to a head. How different leaders, policymakers, and groups of people deal with conflict has a major impact on
1:03:50
whether the country will undergo the needed changes peacefully or violently. You can see signs of this
1:03:57
happening now in a number of countries. Those that have adequate financial conditions, that is, have incomes that
1:04:03
are greater than their expenses and assets that are greater than their liabilities, are in relatively good
1:04:09
shape. Those that do not are in relatively bad shape. They want money
1:04:14
from the others. The problem is that there are many more who are in bad shape relative to those that are in good
1:04:21
shape. You can also see that these different conditions are big drivers of the differences in what is now happening
1:04:27
to most aspects of these countries, states, cities, companies, and people. For example, their education,
1:04:34
healthcare, infrastructure, and well-being. You can also see big cultural differences in how countries
1:04:40
approach their stressful conditions with some approaching them more harmoniously than others who are more inclined to
1:04:47
fight. Because stage 5 is such a pivotal stage in the internal cycle and because
1:04:52
it's the stage that many countries, most importantly the US are now in, I will
1:04:57
devote some time to going through the cause effect relationships at play during it and the key indicators to
1:05:03
watch in examining its progression. Then I will turn more specifically to where the United States
1:05:11
stands. The classic toxic mix. The classic toxic mix of forces
1:05:18
that brings about big internal conflicts consists of one the country and the
1:05:23
people in the country or state or city being in bad financial shape. For example, having big debt and non-debt
1:05:30
obligations. two, large income, wealth, and values gaps within that entity, and three, a
1:05:38
severe negative economic shock. That confluence typically brings
1:05:43
about disorder, conflict, and sometimes civil wars. The economic shock can come
1:05:49
about for many reasons, including financial bubbles that burst, acts of nature, such as pandemics, droughts, and
1:05:55
floods, and wars. It creates a financial stress test. The financial conditions as
1:06:02
measured by incomes relative to expenses and assets relative to liabilities that exist at the time of the stress test are
1:06:08
the shock absorbers. The sizes of the gaps in incomes, wealth, and values are
1:06:14
the degrees of fragility of the system. When the financial problems occur, they typically first hit the private sector
1:06:21
and then the public sector. Because governments will never let the private sector's financial problems sink the
1:06:27
entire system. It is the government's financial condition that matters most. When the government runs out of buying
1:06:34
power, there is a collapse. But on the way to a collapse, there is a lot of fighting for money and political power.
1:06:42
From studying 50 plus civil wars and revolutions, it became clear that the single most reliable leading indicator
1:06:49
of civil war or revolution is bankrupt government finances combined with big
1:06:54
wealth gaps. That is because when the government lacks financial power, it can't financially save those entities in
1:07:01
the private sector that the government needs to save to keep the system running as most governments led by the United
1:07:07
States did at the end of 2008. It can't buy what it needs and it can't pay
1:07:12
people to do what it needs them to do. It is out of power. A classic marker of being in
1:07:19
stage 5 and a leading indicator of the loss of borrowing and spending power, which is one of the triggers for going
1:07:25
into stage six, is that the government has large deficits that are creating more debt to be sold than buyers other
1:07:31
than the government's own central bank are willing to buy. That leading indicator is turned on when
1:07:37
governments that can't print money have to raise taxes and cut spending or when those that can print money print a lot
1:07:44
of it and buy a lot of government debt. To be more specific, when the government runs out of money by running a big
1:07:51
deficit, having large debts, and not having access to adequate credit, it has limited options. It can either raise
1:07:58
taxes and cut spending a lot, or print a lot of money, which depreciates its value. Those governments that have the
1:08:05
option to print money always do so because that is the much less painful path. But it leads investors to run out
1:08:12
of the money and debt that is being printed. Those governments that can't print money have to raise taxes and cut
1:08:18
spending, which drives those with money to run out of the country or state or city because paying more taxes and
1:08:24
losing services is intolerable. If these entities that can't print money have large wealth gaps
1:08:31
among their constituents, these moves typically lead to some form of civil war or
1:08:37
revolution. To be clear, when a government's finances are in bad shape, that does not necessarily mean it will
1:08:43
run out of buying power. But it does mean that there is a much higher risk of that happening than if the government
1:08:48
were in a financially strong position. At the time of this writing, this late cycle debt dynamic is now
1:08:56
playing out in the United States at both the state and federal levels. With the main difference between them being that
1:09:02
state governments can't print money to pay their debts, while the federal government can. The federal government
1:09:08
and many state and city governments have large deficits, large debts, and large wealth gaps. And the central bank, the
1:09:15
federal reserve, has the power to print money. So, at the time of this writing, the central bank is printing a lot of
1:09:22
money and buying a lot of federal government debt, which finances the government spending that is much bigger
1:09:28
than the federal government's intake. That has helped the federal government and those it is trying to help. Though,
1:09:34
it has also cost those who are holding dollars and dollar debt a lot in real purchasing power. Those places, cities,
1:09:43
states, and countries that have the largest wealth gaps, the largest debts, and the worst declines in incomes are
1:09:49
most likely to have the greatest conflicts. Interestingly, those states and cities in the US that have the
1:09:56
highest per capita income and wealth levels tend to be the states and cities that are the most indebted and have the
1:10:02
largest wealth gaps. For example, cities like San Francisco, Chicago, and New York City. and states like Connecticut,
1:10:09
Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey. Facing these conditions,
1:10:15
expenditures have to be cut or more money has to be raised in some way. The
1:10:20
next question becomes who will pay to fix them? The halves or the have nots.
1:10:25
Obviously, it can't be the have-s. Expenditure cuts are most intolerable for those who are poorest.
1:10:32
So, there needs to be more taxation of people who can afford to pay more. and there is a heightened risk of some form
1:10:38
of civil war or revolution. But when the halves realize that they will be taxed
1:10:44
to pay for debt service and to reduce the deficits, they typically leave causing the hollowing out process. This
1:10:51
is currently motivating movements from some states to others in the US. If bad
1:10:57
economic conditions occur, that hastens the process. These circumstances largely
1:11:02
drive the tax cycle. History shows that raising taxes and
1:11:07
cutting spending when there are large wealth gaps and bad economic conditions more than anything else has been a
1:11:14
leading indicator of civil wars or revolutions of some type. To be clear, they don't have to be violent, though
1:11:20
they can be. I see these cycles transpiring in my personal interactions. For example, I
1:11:27
live in the state of Connecticut, which has the highest per capita income in the country, the largest wealth gap and
1:11:33
income gap in the country, and one of the largest per capita debt and unfunded pension obligations in the country. I
1:11:40
see how the halves and the haveotss are focused on their own lives and spend little time worrying about the other
1:11:47
because they don't have much contact. I have windows into what the lives of
1:11:52
both the halves and the have nots are like because I have contact with the people in our community of halves and
1:11:58
because the work my wife does to help disengaged and disconnected high school students and disadvantaged communities
1:12:05
brings her into contact with people who live in the communities of the have-s. I see how terrible the
1:12:11
conditions are in those have- not communities and how the halves who appear rich and decadent to the have-s
1:12:18
don't feel rich. I see how they are all focused on their own struggles with the
1:12:24
halves struggling with work life balance, making sure their kids are well educated, etc. And the have nots
1:12:31
struggling with finding income, food security, avoiding violence, trying to get their kids a quality education, etc.
1:12:38
Of course, these two kinds of struggles aren't equivalent. Still, in both cases,
1:12:44
I have found that people are focused on their own issues and communities and don't understand the circumstances of
1:12:49
those they don't have direct contact with. In many communities, people and most heartbreakingly the children are
1:12:57
desperately poor and neglected. There is an acute shortage of money for basics such as adequate school supplies,
1:13:03
nutrition, and health care, and an environment of violence and trauma that perpetuates a cycle in which children
1:13:09
are brought up intellectually and physically malnourished and traumatized. This leaves them disadvantaged as they
1:13:16
grow into adulthood, which makes it hard for them to earn a living, which perpetuates the cycle. Consider this
1:13:23
fact. A recent study that our foundation funded showed that 22% of the high
1:13:28
school students in Connecticut, the richest state in the country by income per capita, are either disengaged or
1:13:35
disconnected. A disengaged student is one who has an absentee rate of greater than 25% and is failing classes. A
1:13:43
disconnected student is one who the system can't track because they dropped out. Imagine the consequences in 10
1:13:50
years and the human and social costs of this cycle. Our society has not
1:13:56
established limits to how terrible it will allow conditions to get. I see how both groups are more
1:14:03
likely to have critical stereotypical impressions of each other that make them more inclined to dislike each other than
1:14:09
to view themselves empathetically as members of one community in which they should help each other.
1:14:16
I see how difficult it can be to help each other because of these stereotypes and because the halves don't feel that
1:14:22
they have more than enough or that the haveotss deserve their financial support and I fear what the future might hold
1:14:29
because of the existing circumstances and how they are likely to worsen. I've seen closeup how co inflicted health and
1:14:37
budget shocks have brought to the surface the terrible conditions of the have knots and are worsening the
1:14:43
financial gaps that could bring about the classic toxic mix dynamic averages don't matter as much as
1:14:50
the number of people who are suffering and their power. Those who favor policies that are good for the whole,
1:14:58
for example, free trade, globalization, advances in technology that replace people without thinking about what
1:15:05
happens if the whole is not divided in a way that benefits most people are missing the fact that the whole is at
1:15:12
risk. To have peace and prosperity, a society must have productivity that benefits most people. Do you think we
1:15:19
have this today? What does history show as the path that bankrupt governments can follow to raise
1:15:26
productivity that benefits most people? It shows that restructuring and/or devaluing enough of the previously
1:15:33
created debt and non-debt obligations helps a lot. That is classic in stages
1:15:39
five and six. Once the restructuring or devaluation reduces the debt burdens,
1:15:44
which is typically painful at the time, the reduced debt burdens allow for a rebuilding.
1:15:51
An essential ingredient for success is that the debt and money that are created are used to produce productivity gains
1:15:57
and favorable returns on investment rather than just being given away without yielding productivity and income
1:16:04
gains. If it is given away without yielding these gains, the money will be devalued to the point that it won't
1:16:10
leave the government or anyone else with much buying power. History shows that lending and spending
1:16:17
on items that produce broad-based productivity gains and returns on investment that exceed the borrowing
1:16:22
costs result in living standards rising with debts being paid off. So, these are
1:16:28
good policies. If the amount of money being lent to finance the debt is inadequate, it is perfectly fine for the
1:16:35
central bank to print the money and be the lender of last resort as long as the money is invested to have a return that
1:16:41
is large enough to service the debt. History shows and logic dictates that
1:16:47
investing well in education at all levels, including job training, infrastructure, and research that yields
1:16:53
productive discoveries works very well. For example, big education and infrastructure programs have paid off
1:17:00
nearly all the time. For example, in the Tang Dynasty and many other Chinese dynasties in the Roman Empire, in the
1:17:07
Umiad Caliphate, in the Mughal Empire in India, in Japan's Maji restoration, and
1:17:12
in China's educational development programs over the last couple of decades, though they have long lead
1:17:19
times. In fact, improvements in education and infrastructure, even those financed by debt, were essential
1:17:25
ingredients behind the rises of virtually all empires. And declines in the quality of these investments were
1:17:31
almost always ingredients behind empires declines. If done well, these
1:17:37
interventions can more than counterbalance the classic toxic mix. The classic toxic mix is usually
1:17:44
accompanied by other problems. The more of the following conditions that are in place, the higher the probability of
1:17:50
having a severe conflict like a civil war or revolution.
1:17:56
Decadence. While early in the cycle there is typically more spending of time and money on productive things, later in
1:18:03
the cycle time and money go more toward indulgent things. For example, the finer things like expensive residences, art,
1:18:10
jewelry, and clothes. This begins in stage four when such spending is fashionable, but by stage 5 it begins to
1:18:18
appear grotesque. Often that decadent spending is debt financed which worsens the
1:18:24
financial conditions. The change in psychology that typically goes along with these changes is understandable.
1:18:30
The halves feel that they have earned their money so they can spend it on luxuries if they like while the have
1:18:37
view such spending at the same time they are suffering as unfair and selfish.
1:18:42
Besides increasing resentments, decadent spending, as distinct from saving and
1:18:47
investing, reduces productivity. What a society spends
1:18:52
money on matters. When it spends on investment items that yield productivity and income gains, it makes for a better
1:18:59
future than when it spends on consumption items that don't raise productivity and
1:19:05
income. Bureaucracy. While early in the internal order cycle, bureaucracy is low, it is
1:19:13
high late in the cycle, which makes sensible and needed decision-making more
1:19:18
difficult. That is because things tend to get more complex as they develop until they reach the point where even
1:19:24
obviously good things can't be done, necessitating revolutionary changes. In
1:19:30
a legal and contract-based system which has many benefits, this can become a
1:19:35
problem because the law can stand in the way of doing obviously good things. I
1:19:40
will give you an example that I am close to because my wife and I care about it. Because the US Constitution doesn't
1:19:48
make education a federal government responsibility, it has predominantly been a state and local responsibility
1:19:54
with school funding coming from revenue raised by local taxes in cities and towns. Though it varies from state to
1:20:01
state, typically those children in richer towns and richer states receive a much better education than those in
1:20:07
poorer towns in poorer states. This is obviously unfair and unproductive even
1:20:13
though most people agree that children should have equal opportunities in education. But because this structure is
1:20:19
so ingrained in our political system, it is nearly impossible to fix without a revolutionary reinvention of how we
1:20:26
approach it. There are more examples of the bureaucracy standing in the way of doing sensible, productive things than I
1:20:33
have time and space to convey here. It is now a big problem in
1:20:39
America. Populism and extremism. Out of disorder and
1:20:45
discontent come leaders who have strong personalities, are anti- elitist and claim to fight for the common man. They
1:20:52
are called populists. Populism is a political and social phenomenon that appeals to ordinary
1:20:59
people who feel that their concerns are not being addressed by the elites. It typically develops when there are wealth
1:21:05
and opportunity gaps, perceived cultural threats from those with different values both inside and outside the country and
1:21:13
establishment elites and positions of power who are not working effectively for most people.
1:21:19
Populists come into power when these conditions create anger among ordinary people who want those with political
1:21:26
power to be fighters for them. Populists can be of the right or of the left, are
1:21:32
much more extreme than moderates, and tend to appeal to the emotions of ordinary people. They are typically
1:21:38
confrontational rather than collaborative, and exclusive rather than inclusive. This leads to a lot of
1:21:45
fighting between populists of the left and populists of the right over irreconcilable
1:21:51
differences. The extremity of the revolution that occurs under them varies. For example, in the 1930s,
1:21:58
populism of the left took the form of communism and that of the right took the form of fascism, while nonviolent
1:22:05
revolutionary changes took place in the US and the UK. More recently in the
1:22:11
United States, the election of Donald Trump in 2016 was a move to populism of
1:22:16
the right, while the popularity of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Alexandria Okasiocortez reflects the
1:22:23
popularity of populism of the left. There are increased political movements toward populism in a number of
1:22:29
countries. It could be said that the election of Joe Biden reflects a desire for less extremism and more moderation,
1:22:36
though time will tell. Watch populism and polarization as
1:22:41
markers. The more that populism and polarization exist, the further along a
1:22:47
nation is in stage five and the closer it is to civil war and revolution. In stage five, moderates
1:22:54
become the minority. In stage six, they cease to
1:23:00
exist. Class warfare. In stage five, class warfare
1:23:05
intensifies. That is because, as a rule, during times of increased hardship and
1:23:11
conflict, there is an increased inclination to look at people in stereotypical ways as members of one or
1:23:17
more classes and to look at these classes as either being enemies or allies. In stage 5, this begins to
1:23:24
become much more apparent. In stage six, it becomes dangerous.
1:23:30
A classic marker in stage 5 that increases in stage six is the demonization of those in other classes
1:23:37
which typically produces one or more scapegoat classes who are commonly believed to be the source of the
1:23:43
problems. This leads to a drive to exclude, imprison or destroy them which
1:23:48
happens in stage six. Ethnic, racial and socioeconomic groups are often
1:23:53
demonized. The most classic horrific example of this comes from the Nazis treatment of Jews who were blamed and
1:24:01
persecuted for virtually all of Germany's problems. Chinese minorities living in non-Chinese countries have
1:24:07
been demonized and scapegoed during periods of economic and social stress. In the UK, Catholics were demonized and
1:24:14
scapegoed in numerous stressful periods such as the Glorious Revolution and the English Civil War.
1:24:21
Rich capitalists are commonly demonized, especially those who are viewed to be making their money at the expense of the
1:24:27
poor. Demonizing and scapegoating are a classic symptom and problem that we must
1:24:32
keep an eye on. The loss of truth in the public
1:24:38
domain. Not knowing what is true because of distortions in the media and
1:24:43
propaganda increases as people become more polarized, emotional, and politically motivated. In stage five,
1:24:51
those who are fighting typically work with those in the media to manipulate people's emotions to gain support and to
1:24:57
destroy the opposition. In other words, media folks of the left join with others of the left
1:25:03
and media folks of the right join with others of the right in the dirty fight. The media goes wild like vigilantes.
1:25:11
People are commonly attacked and essentially tried and found guilty in the media and they have their lives
1:25:17
ruined without a judge and jury. A common move among 1930s populists of
1:25:22
the left, communists, and of the right, fascists, was to take control of the
1:25:28
media and establish ministers of propaganda to guide them. The media they
1:25:33
produced was explicitly aimed at turning the population against the groups that the governments considered enemies of
1:25:39
the state. The government of the democraticallyrun United Kingdom created a ministry of information during World
1:25:46
War I and World War II to spread government propaganda. And leading newspaper publishers were elevated by
1:25:52
the government if they did what the government wanted them to do to win the propaganda war or were vilified and
1:25:58
suffered if they didn't cooperate. Viccount Northcliffe, who controlled just under half of daily newspaper
1:26:05
circulation in the UK around World War I, was known for anti-German coverage
1:26:10
and was made director of propaganda in enemy countries by the government in
1:26:15
1918. Revolutionaries did the same distorting of the truth in all sorts of publications. During the French
1:26:22
Revolution, newspapers run by revolutionaries pushed anti- monarchist and anti-religious sentiment. But when
1:26:29
those revolutionaries attained power, they shut down dissenting newspapers during the reign of terror. During times
1:26:35
of great wealth gaps and populist thinking, stories that bring down elites are popular and lucrative, especially
1:26:42
those that bring down left-leaning elites in right-leaning media outlets and those that bring down right-leaning
1:26:48
elites in left-leaning media outlets. History shows that significant increases
1:26:53
in these activities are a problem that is typical of stage 5 and that when combined with the ability to inflict
1:27:00
other punishments, the media becomes a powerful weapon. It is well recognized this is
1:27:07
happening at the time of this writing. The perceived truth in media, both traditional and social, is lower than at
1:27:14
any other time in our lifetimes. For example, a 2019 Gallup poll found
1:27:20
that only 13% of Americans surveyed have a great deal of trust in the media and
1:27:26
only 41% of those surveyed have either a fair or great deal of trust in the
1:27:31
media. That compares with 72% who trusted the media in
1:27:36
1976. This is not just a fringe media problem. It is a mainstream media
1:27:41
problem and a problem for our whole society. The dramatically decreased trustworthiness has even plagued former
1:27:48
icons of journalistic trust such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, which have seen their trust
1:27:54
ratings plunge. In addition to being politically motivated, sensationalistic
1:28:00
stories have become commercially rewarding at a time when the media business is in financial trouble. Most
1:28:06
of the media folks I speak with share my concerns, though they typically won't share them openly. Still in reflecting
1:28:13
on the problem, Martin Baron, the executive editor of the Washington Post said, "If you have a society where
1:28:19
people can't agree on the basic facts, how do you have a functioning democracy?" This dynamic is impeding
1:28:27
free speech because people are afraid to speak up because of how they will be attacked in both traditional and social
1:28:33
media by distortions that are meant to bring them down. Even very capable and powerful people
1:28:40
are now too afraid of the media to speak up about important matters or run for public office. Since most high-profile
1:28:47
people are torn down, most everyone I speak with agrees that it is dangerous to be a high-profile vocal person who
1:28:54
fights for truth and justice, especially if one offends people who are inclined to use the media to fight. Though not
1:29:01
discussed in public because of fears of media reprisals, this issue is continuously discussed in private. For
1:29:09
example, during a lunch I had not long ago with a general who had held a very high political position and had just
1:29:15
left government service, we explored what he would do next. I asked him what
1:29:21
he was most passionate about. He said, "Of course, helping my country." I asked
1:29:26
him whether he would consider running for elected office and he explained that while he was willing to die for his
1:29:31
country, he couldn't bring himself to run for public office because of how enemies would use the media and social
1:29:37
media to make up lies to harm him and his family. This general and almost
1:29:42
everyone I know who we should listen to are afraid to speak openly because they fear that attacks by extremists who
1:29:49
oppose them will be enabled and amplified by the sensationalistic media.
1:29:55
Many of my friends tell me that I'm crazy to speak so openly about controversial things such as those
1:30:01
covered in this book because it is inevitable that some people or groups will try to take me down via the media.
1:30:08
I think they're probably right, but I won't let the risks dissuade me. What can be done? The news media is
1:30:16
unique in being the only industry that operates without quality controls or checks on its power. I and most others
1:30:23
believe that it would be terrible for our government to regulate it and at the same time believe that something has to
1:30:29
be done to fix the problem. Perhaps if people protest enough, the media could be motivated to create a self-regulatory
1:30:36
organization to create and regulate ratings the way the Motion Picture Association did. I don't have a clue
1:30:42
about what should be done because this problem isn't my area of expertise and it's not my place to offer suggestions
1:30:49
to try to fix the problem. However, it is my responsibility to point out that we are in an era in which
1:30:56
sensationalism, commercialism, and political desires to manipulate people's views have superseded accuracy and
1:31:03
journalistic integrity as the primary objectives of most of those in the media and that this is like a cancer that
1:31:09
threatens our well-being. If you believe that fake and distorted media is a problem and you are
1:31:15
interested in watching the media propaganda for clues about whether and how this is transpiring, here are a few
1:31:22
commonly recommended things to look out for. Ask yourself. One, does the story consist of
1:31:30
emotionally triggering unsubstantiated accusations or are the facts substantiated and the sources provided?
1:31:37
When the facts are put aside to create an exciting story and the sources are undisclosed, don't believe the
1:31:44
story. Two, does the writer welcome or not welcome replies or arguments that
1:31:50
refute what they are asserting? And are they willing or not willing to publish them along with what they
1:31:56
published? Three, are the accusations in the story consistent with what has been
1:32:02
identified and proven in the legal system? If people or groups are accused in the media of doing bad things, but
1:32:08
they haven't been accused and judged to have done bad things in the legal system, which follows a process that
1:32:14
tries to weigh the evidence to get at what is true, at least ask yourself why that is, and probably don't believe the
1:32:22
story. Four, if the writer or outlet has previously shown themselves to be biased, assume that they and their
1:32:29
stories are biased. rule following fades and raw fighting
1:32:36
begins. When the causes that people are passionately behind are more important to them than the system for making
1:32:43
decisions, the system is in jeopardy. Rules and laws work only when they are
1:32:48
crystal clear and most people value working within them enough that they are willing to compromise in order to make
1:32:54
them work well. If both of these are less than excellent, the legal system is
1:33:00
in jeopardy. If the competing parties are unwilling to try to be reasonable with each other and to make decisions
1:33:05
civily in pursuit of the well-being of the whole, which will require them to give up things that they want and might
1:33:12
win in a fight, there will be a sort of civil war that will test the relative powers of the relevant parties. In this
1:33:19
stage, winning at all costs is the game, and playing dirty is the
1:33:25
norm. Late in stage five is when reason is abandoned in favor of passion.
1:33:31
When winning becomes the only thing that matters, unethical fighting becomes progressively more forceful in
1:33:37
self-reinforcing ways. When everyone has causes that they are fighting for and no one can agree on anything, the system is
1:33:44
on the brink of civil war or revolution. This typically happens in a
1:33:49
couple of ways. Late in stage 5, it is common for the legal and police systems to be used
1:33:56
as political weapons by those who can control them. Also, private police systems form. For example, thugs who
1:34:03
beat people up and take their assets and bodyguards to protect people from these things happening to them. For instance,
1:34:10
the Nazi party formed a paramilitary wing before it came to power that then became an official force when the Nazis
1:34:17
were in power. The short-lived British Union of Fascists in the 1930s and the
1:34:22
Ku Klux Clan in the US were effectively paramilitary groups as well.
1:34:27
Such cases are quite normal. So view their development as a marker of moving to the next
1:34:34
stage. Late in stage 5, there are increasing numbers of protests that become increasingly violent. Because
1:34:41
there is not always a clear line between a healthy protest and the beginnings of a revolution. Leaders in power often
1:34:48
struggle over how to allow protests without giving the perceived freedom to revolt against the system. Leaders must
1:34:55
manage these situations well. A classic dilemma arises when demonstrations start
1:35:00
to cross over into revolution. Both giving the freedom to protest and suppressing protests are
1:35:07
risky paths for leaders, as either path could lead the revolution to get strong enough to topple the system. No system
1:35:14
allows people to bring down the system. In most, an attempt to do so is treason, typically punishable by death.
1:35:22
Nonetheless, it is the job of revolutionaries to bring down systems. So, governments and revolutionaries test
1:35:28
each other to see what the limits are. When broad-based discontent bubbles up
1:35:33
and those in power allow it to grow, it can boil over to the point that when they try to put a lid on it, it
1:35:39
explodes. The conflicts in the late part of stage 5 typically build up to a crescendo that
1:35:45
triggers the violent fighting that signifies the transition into what historians stamp as official civil war
1:35:51
periods, which I am identifying as stage six in the big cycle. People dying in the fighting is
1:35:59
the marker that almost certainly signifies the progression to the next and more violent civil war stage, which
1:36:06
will continue until the winners and losers are clearly determined.
1:36:11
That brings me to my next principle. When in doubt, get out. If you don't want to be in a civil war or a war, you
1:36:18
should get out while the getting is good. This is typically laid in stage 5.
1:36:23
History has shown that when things get bad, the doors typically close for people who want to leave. The same is
1:36:29
true for investments and money as countries introduced capital controls and other measures during such times.
1:36:37
Crossing the line from stage five when there are very bad financial conditions and intense internal and external
1:36:44
conflict exist to stage six when there is civil war occurs when the system for
1:36:49
resolving disagreements goes from working to not working. In other words,
1:36:55
it happens when the system is broken beyond repair. People are violent with each other and the leadership has lost
1:37:00
control. As you might imagine, it is a much bigger deal to break a system or order
1:37:07
and build a new one than it is to make revolutionary changes within an existing system or order. Though breaking a
1:37:14
system or order is more traumatic, it isn't necessarily a worse path than operating within a system.
1:37:22
Deciding whether to keep and renovate something old that is not working well or to dispose of it and replace it with
1:37:29
something new is never easy, especially when the something new is not clearly known and what is being replaced is as
1:37:36
important as the domestic order. Nonetheless, it happens though typically it is not decided on intellectually. It
1:37:43
is more often emotionally driven. When one is in stage five, like
1:37:48
the US is now, the biggest question is how much the system will bend before it
1:37:54
breaks. The democratic system, which allows the population to do pretty much whatever it decides to do, produces more
1:38:02
bending because the people can make leadership changes and only have themselves to blame. In this system,
1:38:08
regime changes can more easily happen in a peaceful way. However, the oneperson
1:38:14
one vote democratic process has the drawback of having leaders selected via popularity contests by people who are
1:38:22
largely not doing the sort of thoughtful review of capabilities that most organizations would do when trying to
1:38:28
find the right person for an important job. Democracy has also been shown to
1:38:33
break down in times of great conflict. Democracy requires consensus
1:38:38
decisionmaking and compromise which requires a lot of people who have opposing views to work well with each
1:38:44
other within the system. That ensures that parties that have significant constituencies can be represented. But
1:38:51
like all big committees of people who have widely different views and might even dislike each other, the
1:38:57
decision-making system does not lend itself to efficient decisionm. The biggest risk to
1:39:04
democracies is that they produce such fragmented and antagonistic decision-making that they can be
1:39:09
ineffective which leads to bad results which leads to revolutions led by populist autocrats who represent large
1:39:16
segments of the population who want to have a strong capable leader get control of the chaos and make the country work
1:39:23
well for them. Also noteworthy, history has shown that during times of great conflict,
1:39:30
federalist democracies like the US typically have conflicts between the states and the central government over
1:39:36
their relative powers. That would be a marker to look out for that hasn't yet arisen much in the US. It's happening
1:39:43
would signify the continued progression toward stage six. There are far too many breakdowns
1:39:50
of democracies to explore, let alone describe. While I looked into a number of them to see the patterns, I haven't
1:39:57
fully mined them and I'm not going to dive into them here. I will say that the factors described in the explanations of
1:40:04
stage 5 when taken to the extreme, most importantly terrible finances,
1:40:09
decadence, internal strife and disorder and/or major external conflict lead to a
1:40:14
dysfunctional set of conditions and a fight for power led by a strong leader.
1:40:20
Archetypical examples include Athens from the late 400s to the 300s B.C.E.,
1:40:25
the end of the Roman Republic in the century or so preceding 27 B.CE. Germany's VHimar Republic in the
1:40:32
1920s, and the weak democracies of Italy, Japan, and Spain in the 1920s and
1:40:38
1930s that turned into autocracies of the right, fascism, to bring order to
1:40:43
the chaos. The Roman Republic and Athens both had democratic elements, but not everyone
1:40:49
was able to participate or vote equally. Although democracies have existed for thousands of years, it is only recently
1:40:56
that most people were allowed to vote. For example, in the US, African-Amean men were not universally allowed to vote
1:41:03
until 1870 and women of all races until 1920. Different stages require different
1:41:10
types of leaders to get the best results. Stage five is a juncture in which one path could lead to civil war
1:41:17
or revolution and the other could lead to peaceful and ideally prosperous
1:41:22
coexistence. Obviously, the peaceful and prosperous path is the ideal path, but it is the much more difficult path to
1:41:29
pull off. That path requires a strong peacemaker who goes out of their way to
1:41:34
bring the country together, including reaching out to the other side to involve them in the decision-making and
1:41:40
reshaping the order in a way that most people agree is fair and works well.
1:41:45
That is highly productive in a way that benefits most people. There are few such
1:41:51
cases in history. We pray for them. The second type is a strong fighter who is
1:41:57
capable of taking the country through the hell of civil war or
1:42:02
revolution. Stage six, when there are civil wars. Civil wars inevitably happen. So
1:42:10
rather than assuming it won't happen here, which most people in most countries assume after an extended
1:42:16
period of not having them, it is better to be wary of them and look for the markers to indicate how close one is.
1:42:23
While in the last section we looked at nonviolent revolutions that took place within the order. In this section we
1:42:30
will be looking at the markers and the patterns of civil wars and revolutions that were almost always violent and
1:42:36
toppled the old order and replaced it with a new one. Though there are innumerable examples that I could have
1:42:42
examined to understand how they work, I chose what I believe are the 29 most significant ones which are shown in the
1:42:49
attached PDF table. I categorized this group into those that
1:42:54
produced big changes to the system or regime and those that did not. For
1:42:59
example, the US Civil War was a really bloody civil war that failed to overturn
1:43:04
the system or order. So, it is in the second group at the bottom of the table, while those that toppled the system or
1:43:11
order are at the top. These categories are of course imprecise, but once again,
1:43:16
we won't let imprecision stand in the way of seeing what we couldn't see if we insisted on being precise. Most of these
1:43:24
conflicts, though not all of them, transpired in the archetypical way described in this
1:43:29
section. A classic example of a civil war breaking the system and having to build a new system is the Russian
1:43:36
Revolution or Civil War of 1917. This put into place the communist
1:43:41
internal order that eventually entered stage 5 in the late 1980s which led it
1:43:46
to attempt to make revolutionary changes within the system called paristroka that is restructuring which failed and were
1:43:54
followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union's order in 1991. The communist domestic order
1:44:00
lasted 74 years from 1917 until 1991.
1:44:05
That order was replaced by the new system or order that is now governing Russia which after the collapse of the
1:44:12
old order was built in the classic ways described earlier in this chapter in my explanations of stages 1 and
1:44:19
two. Another is Japan's Maji restoration which came about as a result of a
1:44:24
three-year revolution 1866 to69 that happened because the Japanese were
1:44:30
closed off to the outside world and failed to advance. The Americans forced
1:44:35
the Japanese to open, which prompted a revolutionary group to fight and defeat the rulers led by the military shogun in
1:44:43
battle, which led to overturning the internal order then run by the four classes, the military, farmers,
1:44:49
artisans, and merchants that had ruled Japan. This old Japanese order run by
1:44:55
traditional people was ultra-conservative. For example, social mobility was outlawed and was replaced
1:45:02
by revolutionaries who were relatively progressive and changed everything by reinstating the powers of a modernizing
1:45:09
emperor. Early in this period, there were lots of labor disputes, strikes, and riots that resulted from the classic
1:45:15
triggers of wealth gaps and bad economic conditions. In the reform process, the
1:45:21
leadership provided universal elementary education for both boys and girls, adopted capitalism, and opened the
1:45:28
country up to the outside world. They did this with new technologies, which led them to become very competitive and
1:45:34
gain wealth. There are many such cases of countries that did the right things to produce
1:45:40
revolutionarily beneficial improvements, just as there are many cases of revolutionaries doing the wrong things
1:45:46
that inflicted terrible pain on their people for decades. By the way, as a result of its
1:45:52
reformations, Japan went on to move through the classic stages of the big cycle. It became extremely successful
1:46:00
and rich, but over time it became decadent, overextended, and fragmented. had an economic depression and fought
1:46:06
expensive wars, all of which led to a classic demise. Its maji order and its
1:46:12
classic big cycle lasted for 76 years from 1869 to
1:46:19
1945. Civil wars and revolutions inevitably take place to radically change the internal order. They include
1:46:26
total restructurings of wealth and political power that include complete restructurings of debt and financial
1:46:33
ownership and political decision-making. These changes are the natural consequence of needing to make
1:46:39
big changes that can't be made within the existing system. Almost all systems
1:46:44
encounter them. That is because almost all systems benefit some classes of people at the expense of other classes
1:46:51
which eventually becomes intolerable to the point that there is a fight to determine the path forward. When the
1:46:57
gaps in wealth and values become very wide and bad economic conditions ensue so that the system is not working for a
1:47:04
large percentage of the people, the people will fight to change the system. Those who are suffering the most
1:47:10
economically will fight to get more wealth and power from those who have wealth and power and who benefit from
1:47:16
the existing system. Naturally, the revolutionaries want to radically change the system. So naturally, they are
1:47:23
willing to break the laws that those in power demand they adhere to. These revolutionary changes typically happen
1:47:29
violently through civil wars. Though, as previously described, they can come about peacefully without toppling the
1:47:36
system. The periods of civil war are typically very brutal. Typically, early on, these
1:47:43
wars are forceful and orderly struggles for power. And as the fighting and emotions intensify and the sides do
1:47:50
anything to win, the levels of brutality accelerate unexpectedly such that the
1:47:55
actual levels of brutality that occur in the stage six civil wars and revolutions would have been considered implausible.
1:48:02
In stage five, the elites and moderates generally flee, are imprisoned, or are
1:48:07
killed. Reading the stories of civil wars and revolutions such as the Spanish Civil War, the Chinese Civil War, the
1:48:14
Russian Revolution, and the French Revolution made my hair curl. How do they
1:48:20
transpire? Earlier, I described the dynamics of stage 5 that led to crossing the line into stage six. During this
1:48:27
stage, all of those intensify greatly. I will
1:48:33
explain how civil wars and revolutions transpire. As previously described, the
1:48:41
cycle of building wealth and wealth gaps that leads to a very small percentage of the population controlling an
1:48:47
exceptionally large percentage of the wealth eventually results in the poor majority overthrowing the rich minority
1:48:54
via civil wars and revolutions. This has happened more times than one can imagine.
1:49:00
While most of the archetypical civil wars and revolutions shifted power from the right to the left, many shifted
1:49:07
wealth and power to the right and away from those on the left. However, there were fewer of them and they were
1:49:13
different. They typically happened when the existing orders slipped into dysfunctional anarchies and a large
1:49:20
percentage of the population yearned for strong leadership, discipline, and productivity. Examples of revolutions
1:49:27
from the left to the right include Germany, Spain, Japan, and Italy in the
1:49:32
1930s, the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1980s to the early 1990s, the 1976
1:49:39
coup in Argentina replacing Isabel Peron with a military huta, and the coup
1:49:44
leading to the second French Empire in 1851. All those that I examined worked
1:49:50
or didn't work for the same reason. Like those of the left, these new internal orders succeeded when they produced
1:49:57
broad-based economic successes and failed when they did not. Because broad
1:50:02
economic prosperity is the biggest reason a new regime succeeds or fails, the long-term trends have been to both
1:50:09
greater total wealth and broader distribution of the wealth, that is better economic and health outcomes for
1:50:16
the average person. That big picture can be easily lost when one is in and experiencing one part of
1:50:22
the big cycle. Typically, the people who led the civil war or revolution were and still
1:50:29
are well-educated people from middle class backgrounds. For example, three of the key
1:50:34
revolutionary leaders of the French Revolution were George Jacqu Danton, a lawyer raised in a bourgeoa family, Jean
1:50:42
Paul Marat, a physician, scientist and journalist raised in a bajgeois family,
1:50:47
and Maxmillian Robes Pierre, a lawyer and statesman also from a bourgeoa family. This revolution was initially
1:50:54
supported by many liberal aristocrats like the Marque de Lafayette who were raised in moderately well-off families.
1:51:02
Similarly, the leaders of the Russian Revolution were Vladimir Lenon, who studied law, and Leon Trosky, who was
1:51:08
raised in a bourgeoa family of intellectuals. The Chinese civil war was led by Mao, who was from a moderately
1:51:16
well-off family and studied a variety of subjects such as law, economics, and political theory, and Joe Enli, who was
1:51:23
from a scholarly middle-class family of civil servants. These leaders also typically were and
1:51:29
still are charismatic and able to lead and work well with others to build big well-run organizations that have the
1:51:36
power to bring about the revolutions. If you want to look for the revolutionaries of the future, you might keep an eye on
1:51:43
those who have these qualities. Over time, they typically evolve from being idealistic
1:51:48
intellectuals wanting to change the system to be fairer to brutal revolutionaries bent on winning at all
1:51:54
costs. While having large wealth gaps during economically difficult times was
1:52:00
typically the biggest source of conflict, there were always other reasons for conflict that added up to a
1:52:06
lot of opposition to the leadership in the system. Typically in revolutions, the revolutionaries with these different
1:52:13
grievances joined together to make revolutionary changes. While they looked united during the revolution, after
1:52:19
winning the revolution, they typically fought with each other over issues and for power.
1:52:25
As previously mentioned, during the civil war or revolution stage of the cycle, the governments in power almost
1:52:32
always had an acute shortage of money, credit, and buying power. That shortage
1:52:37
created the desire to grab money from those who had it, which led those who had wealth to move it into places and
1:52:43
assets that were safe, which led the governments to stop these movements by imposing capital controls. That is,
1:52:50
controls on movements to other jurisdictions, for example, other countries, to other currencies, or to
1:52:56
assets that are more difficult to tax and/or are less productive, for example,
1:53:01
gold. To make matters even worse, when there was internal disorder, foreign enemies
1:53:08
were more likely to challenge the country. This happens because domestic conflict causes vulnerabilities that
1:53:15
make external wars more likely. Internal conflict splits the people within a
1:53:20
country, is financially taxing on them, and demands attention that leaves less time for the leaders to tend to other
1:53:27
issues. All things that create vulnerabilities for foreign powers to take advantage of.
1:53:33
That is the main reason why internal wars and external wars tend to come close together. Other reasons include
1:53:40
emotions and tempers are heightened. Strong populist leaders who tend to come to power at such times are fighters by
1:53:47
nature. When there are internal conflicts, leaders find that a perceived threat from an external enemy can bring
1:53:54
the country together in support of the leader. So they tend to encourage the conflict. And being deprived leads
1:54:01
people and countries to be more willing to fight for what they need, including resources that other countries
1:54:08
have. Almost all civil wars have had some foreign powers participating in attempt to influence the outcome to
1:54:14
their benefit. The beginnings of civil wars and revolutions aren't clear when they
1:54:20
are happening, though they are obvious when one is deeply in the middle of them. While historians assign dates to the
1:54:26
beginnings and ends of civil wars, they are arbitrary. The truth is that almost
1:54:32
no one at the time knows that a civil war has begun or that it has ended, but they know when they are in them. For
1:54:39
example, many historians have designated July 14th, 1789 as the day the French
1:54:44
Revolution began because a mob stormed an armory in prison called the Bastile.
1:54:50
But nobody at the time thought it was the beginning of the French Revolution or had any idea how terribly brutal that
1:54:56
civil war and revolution would become. While one might not know what's to come, one can have imprecise markers that help
1:55:03
one place where one is to see the direction that one is moving in and to know something about what the next stage
1:55:09
will be like. Civil wars are incredibly brutal because they are fights to the death.
1:55:17
Everyone is an extremist because everyone is forced to pick a side and fight. Also, moderates lose out in knife
1:55:26
fights. As for what types of leaders are best for civil wars and revolutions, they are the inspirational generals.
1:55:33
People who are strong enough to marshall, support, and win the various types of battles they have to win.
1:55:39
Because the fight is brutal, they have to be brutal enough to do whatever is necessary to
1:55:44
win. The time that historians stamp as the Civil War period typically lasts a
1:55:50
few years and determines the official winners and losers, which is conveyed by who gets to occupy the government
1:55:56
buildings in the capital. But like the beginnings, the ends of civil wars and revolutions are not as clearly defined
1:56:02
as historians convey. The fighting to consolidate power can go on for a long
1:56:08
time after the official civil war is ended. While civil wars and revolutions are
1:56:14
typically extremely painful, they often lead to restructurings that if done well can establish the foundation for
1:56:20
improved future results. What the future after the Civil War or Revolution looks
1:56:26
like depends on how the next steps are handled.
1:56:33
Conclusion. My study of history has taught me that nothing is forever other than evolution. And within evolution,
1:56:40
there are cycles that are like tides that come in and go out and that are hard to change or fight against. To
1:56:47
handle these changes well, it is essential to know which stage of the cycle one is in and to know timeless and
1:56:53
universal principles for dealing with it. As conditions change, the best approaches change. That is, what is best
1:57:00
depends on the circumstances and the circumstances are always changing in the ways we just looked at. For that reason,
1:57:07
it is a mistake to rigidly believe that any economic or political system is always best because there will certainly
1:57:14
be times when that system is not best for the circumstances at hand. And if a society doesn't adapt, it will die. That
1:57:22
is why constantly reforming systems to adapt well is best. The test of any
1:57:28
system is simply how well it works in delivering what most of the people want. And this can be objectively measured
1:57:34
which we can do and will continue to do. Having said that, the lesson from
1:57:40
history that comes through most loudly and most clearly is that skilled collaborations to produce productive
1:57:46
win-win relationships to both grow and divide the pie well so that most people
1:57:52
are happy are much more rewarding and much less painful than fighting civil wars over wealth and power that lead to
1:57:59
one side subjugating the other side. Chapter 6. The big cycle of external
Chapter 6: The Big Cycle of External Order and Disorder
1:58:06
order and disorder. Relationships between people and the orders that govern them work in
1:58:14
basically the same ways whether they are internal or external and they blend together. In fact, it wasn't long ago
1:58:21
that there were no distinctions between internal and external orders because there were no clearly defined and
1:58:27
mutually recognized boundaries between countries. For that reason, the six-stage cycle of
1:58:33
going between order and disorder that I described in the last chapter about what happens within countries works the same
1:58:39
way between countries with one big exception. International relations are
1:58:45
driven much more by raw power dynamics. That is because all governance systems
1:58:50
require effective and agreed upon one laws and law-making abilities, two law
1:58:56
enforcement capabilities, for example, police. Three, ways of adjudicating, for
1:59:02
example, judges, and four, clear and specified consequences that both suit
1:59:07
crimes and are enforced, for example, fines and incarcerations. and those things either don't exist or are not as
1:59:14
effective in guiding relations between countries as they are in guiding relations within
1:59:20
them. While attempts have been made to make the external order more rule- abiding, for example, via the League of
1:59:26
Nations and the United Nations, by and large, they have failed because these organizations have not had more wealth
1:59:33
and power than the most powerful countries. When individual countries have more power than the collectives of
1:59:40
countries, the more powerful individual countries rule. For example, if the US,
1:59:45
China or other countries have more power than the United Nations, then the US, China or other countries will determine
1:59:52
how things go rather than the United Nations. That is because power prevails
1:59:58
and wealth and power among equals is rarely given up without a fight.
2:00:04
When powerful countries have disputes, they don't get their lawyers to plead their cases to judges. Instead, they
2:00:11
threaten each other and either reach agreements or fight. The international order follows the law of the jungle much
2:00:18
more than it follows international law. There are five major kinds of
2:00:23
fights between countries. Trade and economic wars, technology wars, capital
2:00:29
wars, geopolitical wars, and military wars. Let's begin by briefly defining
2:00:36
them. One, trade and economic wars. Conflicts over tariffs, import export
2:00:42
restrictions, and other ways of damaging arrival economically. Two, technology wars.
2:00:50
Conflicts over which technologies are shared and which are held as protected aspects of national
2:00:56
security. Three, geopolitical wars. conflicts over territory and alliances
2:01:02
that are resolved through negotiations and explicit or implicit commitments, not
2:01:08
fighting. Four, capital wars, conflicts imposed through financial tools such as
2:01:14
sanctions, for example, cutting off money and credit by punishing institutions and governments that offer
2:01:20
it, and limiting foreign access to capital markets.
2:01:25
Five, military wars. Conflicts that involve actual shooting and the
2:01:30
deployment of military forces. Most fights between nations fall
2:01:35
under one or more of those categories. Cyber warfare, for example, has a role in all of them. They are over wealth and
2:01:43
power and the ideologies pertaining to them. While most of these types of wars don't involve shooting and killing, they
2:01:51
are all power struggles. In most cases, the first four kinds of war will evolve over time as intense
2:01:58
competitions between rival nations until a military war begins. These struggles
2:02:03
and wars, whether or not they involve shooting and killing, are exertions of power of one side over the other. They
2:02:10
can be all out or contained depending on how important the issue is and what the
2:02:15
relative powers of the opponents are. But once a military war begins, all four
2:02:20
of the other dimensions will be weaponized to the greatest extent possible. As discussed in the last
2:02:27
several chapters, all of the factors that drive internal and external cycles tend to improve and worsen together.
2:02:35
When things get bad, there are more things to argue over, which leads to greater inclinations to fight. That's
2:02:41
human nature and it is why we have the big cycle which oscillates between good times and bad
2:02:48
ones. Allout wars typically occur when existential issues, ones that are so
2:02:54
essential to the country's existence that people are willing to fight and die for them are at stake and they cannot be
2:03:00
resolved by peaceful means. The wars that result from them make it clear which side gets its way and has
2:03:07
supremacy in subsequent matters. That clarity over who sets the rules then
2:03:13
becomes the basis of a new international order. The next PDF chart shows the
2:03:19
cycles of internal and external peace and conflict in Europe going back to 1500 as reflected in the deaths they
2:03:26
caused. As you can see, there were three big cycles of rising and declining conflict averaging about 150 years each.
2:03:34
Though big civil and external wars last only a short time, they are typically the culmination of the long-standing
2:03:40
conflicts that led up to them. While World Wars 1 and two were separately driven by the classic cycle, they were
2:03:48
also interrelated. As you can see in the PDF chart, each cycle consisted of a
2:03:54
relatively long period of peace and prosperity. For example, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the
2:04:00
Industrial Revolution that swed the seeds for terrible and violent external wars, for example, the 30 Years War, the
2:04:07
Napoleonic Wars, and the two world wars. Both the upswings, the periods of peace
2:04:13
and prosperity, and the downswings, the periods of depression and war affected the whole world. Not all countries
2:04:21
prosper when the leading powers do because countries gain at the expense of others. For example, the decline of
2:04:28
China from around 1840 to 1949, known as the century of humiliation, came about
2:04:35
because the Western powers and Japan exploited China. As you listen, keep in mind that
2:04:42
the two things about war that one can be most confident in are one that it won't
2:04:47
go as planned and two that it will be far worse than imagined. It is for those
2:04:53
reasons that so many of the principles that follow are about ways to avoid shooting wars. Still, whether they are fought for
2:05:01
good reasons or bad, shooting wars happen. To be clear, while I believe most are tragic and fought for
2:05:07
nonsensical reasons, some are worth fighting because the consequences of not fighting them, for example, the loss of
2:05:14
freedom would be intolerable. the timeless and universal forces that
2:05:21
produce changes to the external order. As I explained in chapter 2,
2:05:27
after self-interest and self-s survival, the quest for wealth and power is what most motivates individuals, families,
2:05:34
companies, states, and countries. Because wealth equals power in terms of the ability to build military strength,
2:05:41
control trade, and influence other nations. Domestic and military strength go hand in hand. It takes money to buy
2:05:49
guns, military power. And it takes money to buy butter, domestic social spending
2:05:54
needs. When a country fails to provide adequate amounts of either, it becomes vulnerable to domestic and foreign
2:06:01
opposition. From my study of Chinese dynasties and European empires, I've
2:06:06
learned that the financial strength to outspend one's rivals is one of the most important strengths a country can have.
2:06:14
That is how the United States beat the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Spend enough money in the right ways and you
2:06:20
don't have to have a shooting war. Long-term success depends on sustaining both the guns and the butter without
2:06:28
producing the excesses that lead to their declines. In other words, a country must be strong
2:06:33
enough financially to give its people both a good living standard and protection from outside enemies. The
2:06:40
really successful countries have been able to do that for 200 to 300 years. None has been able to do it
2:06:47
forever. Conflict arises when the dominant power begins to weaken or an emerging power begins to approach it in
2:06:54
strength or both. The greatest risk of military war is when both parties have
2:07:00
one military powers that are roughly comparable and two irreconcilable and
2:07:06
existential differences. As of this writing, the most potentially explosive conflict is that between the United
2:07:12
States and China over Taiwan. The choice that opposing
2:07:17
countries face, either fighting or backing down, is very hard to make. Both
2:07:23
are costly. fighting in terms of lives and money and backing down in terms of the loss of status since it shows
2:07:29
weakness which leads to reduced support. When two competing entities each have the power to destroy the
2:07:36
other, both must have extremely high trust that they won't be unacceptably harmed or killed by the other. Managing
2:07:44
the prisoner's dilemma well, however, is extremely rare.
2:07:49
While there are no rules in international relations other than those the most powerful impose on themselves,
2:07:55
some approaches produce better outcomes than others. Specifically, those that are more likely to lead to win-win
2:08:01
outcomes are better than those that lead to lose-lose outcomes. Hence, this allimportant principle. To get more
2:08:09
win-win outcomes, one needs to negotiate with consideration given to what is most
2:08:14
important to the other party and to oneself and know how to trade them. To
2:08:20
give an oversimplified example of a win-win approach, if each country picks the top 10 things that they want to get
2:08:27
or want to be protected against and allocates 100 points in total to these to express how much they want these
2:08:33
things, they could determine what the best trades would be. For example, I
2:08:38
expect that high on China's list would be the reunification with Taiwan. So high, in fact, that they would go to war
2:08:45
for it. I can't imagine that preventing that from happening peacefully would be nearly as high on the US's list, whereas
2:08:52
something on the US's list would be very high so that they should be willing to trade it to make both sides happy.
2:08:59
Though it might sound naive, I wish the power of thoughtful disagreement could be tapped to deal with the US China
2:09:06
wars. For example, I visualize how wonderful it would be if leaders or representatives of each country were to
2:09:13
have a series of publicly aired thoughtful disagreements like presidential debates that the
2:09:18
populations of both countries could listen to in order to gain both sides perspectives.
2:09:23
I'm sure it would make us much more knowledgeable and empathetic and improve the chances of peaceful
2:09:30
resolutions. Skilled collaborations to produce win-win relationships that both increase and divide up wealth and power
2:09:38
well are much more rewarding and much less painful than wars that lead to one side subjugating the other. Seeing
2:09:46
things through your adversar's eyes and clearly identifying and communicating your red lines to them. That is what
2:09:53
cannot be compromised are the keys to doing this well. Winning means getting
2:09:58
the things that are most important without losing the things that are most important. So wars that cost much more
2:10:05
in lives and money than they provide in benefits are stupid. But stupid wars
2:10:11
still happen all the time for reasons that I will explain. It is far too easy to slip into stupid
2:10:18
wars because of a the prisoners dilemma, b a tit fortat escalation process, c the
2:10:25
perceived costs of backing down for the declining power, and d misunderstandings
2:10:31
existing when decision-making has to be fast. Rival great powers typically find
2:10:37
themselves in the prisoner's dilemma. They need to have ways of assuring the other that they won't try to kill them,
2:10:43
lest the other tries to kill them first. Tit fortat escalations are dangerous in
2:10:48
that they require each side to escalate or lose what the enemy captured in the last move. It is like a game of chicken.
2:10:56
Push it too far and there is a head-on crash. Until emotional appeals that rile
2:11:03
people up increase the dangers of stupid wars. So it is better for leaders to be
2:11:08
truthful and thoughtful in explaining the situation and how they are dealing with it. This is especially essential in
2:11:15
a democracy in which the opinions of the population matter. The worst thing is when leaders
2:11:21
are untruthful and emotional in dealing with their populations and it is worse still when they take over the
2:11:28
media. By and large, the tendency to move between win-win relationships and lose-lose relationships happens in a
2:11:36
cyclical way. People and empires are more likely to have cooperative relationships during good times and to
2:11:42
fight during bad times. When the existing great power is declining in
2:11:48
relation to a rising power, it has a natural tendency to want to maintain the status quo or the existing rules while
2:11:55
the rising power wants to change them to be in line with the changing facts on the ground. While I don't know about the
2:12:02
love part of the saying all is fair and love and war, I know the war part is
2:12:08
right. As an example, in the American Revolutionary War, when the British lined up in rows for the fight and the
2:12:15
American Revolutionaries shot at them from behind trees, the British thought that was unfair and complained. The
2:12:21
revolutionaries won, believing the British were foolish and that the cause of independence and freedom justified
2:12:28
changing the rules of war. That's just how it is. This leads me to one final
2:12:35
principle. Have power, respect power, and use power wisely. Having power is good because
2:12:43
power will win out over agreements, rules, and laws all the time. When push
2:12:48
comes to shove, those who have the power to either enforce their interpretation of the rules and laws or to overturn
2:12:54
them will get what they want. It is important to respect power because it's
2:12:59
not smart to fight a war that one is going to lose. It is preferable to negotiate the best settlement possible.
2:13:06
That is, unless one wants to be a martyr, which is usually for stupid ego reasons rather than for sensible
2:13:12
strategic reasons. It is also important to use power wisely. Using power wisely
2:13:18
doesn't necessarily mean forcing others to give you what you want, that is bullying them. It includes the
2:13:24
recognition that generosity and trust are powerful forces for producing win-win relationships which are
2:13:31
fabulously more rewarding than lose-lose relationships. In other words, it is
2:13:36
often the case that using one's hard powers is not the best path and that using one's soft powers is
2:13:43
preferable. For example, though I always had the ownership power to make decisions at Bridgewater autocratically,
2:13:50
I chose not to use that power. Instead, I created and operated an idea
2:13:56
meritocratic system which I described in principles life and work. I also chose
2:14:01
to be far more generous with the people I worked with than I had to be while maintaining extremely high standards
2:14:07
because I knew that operating that way would produce the amazing relationships and outcomes that we experienced far
2:14:14
better than if I had used my hard powers more forcefully. So, it's important to
2:14:19
remember that great relationships give one great powers and that they are wonderful rewards in and of
2:14:25
themselves. There is nothing more powerful and rewarding for the individual and the collective than the
2:14:31
cooperation of capable people who care for each other and who will give each other all they
2:14:36
can. When thinking about how to use power wisely, it's also important to
2:14:42
decide when to reach an agreement and when to fight. To do that, a party must
2:14:47
imagine how its power will change over time. It is desirable to use one's power
2:14:52
to negotiate an agreement, enforce an agreement, or fight a war when one's power is greatest. That means that it
2:14:59
pays to fight early if one's relative power is declining, and fight later if it's rising. If one is in a lose-lose
2:15:08
relationship, one has to get out of it one way or another, preferably through separation, though possibly through war.
2:15:15
To handle one's power wisely, it's usually best not to show it because it will usually lead others to feel
2:15:21
threatened and build their own threatening powers, which will lead to a mutual escalation that threatens
2:15:27
both. Power is usually best handled like a hidden knife that can be brought out in the event of a fight. But there are
2:15:35
times when showing one's power and threatening to use it are most effective for improving one's negotiating position
2:15:41
and preventing a fight. Knowing what matters most and least to the other party, especially what they will and
2:15:47
won't fight for, allows you to work your way toward an equilibrium that both parties consider a fair resolution of a
2:15:55
dispute. Though it is generally desirable to have power, it is also desirable to not have power that one
2:16:02
doesn't need. That is because maintaining power consumes resources, most importantly, your time and your
2:16:09
money. Also, with power comes the burden of responsibilities. I've often been
2:16:14
struck by how much happier less powerful people can be relative to more powerful
2:16:22
people. Case study World War II. Now that we have covered the dynamics
2:16:28
and principles that drive the external order and disorder cycle, which were derived by looking at many cases, I'd
2:16:35
like to briefly look at the World War II case because it provides the most recent example of the iconic dynamic of going
2:16:42
from peace to war. Though it is only one case, it clearly shows how the
2:16:47
confluence of the three big cycles that is the overlapping and interrelated forces of the money and credit cycle,
2:16:53
the internal order disorder cycle and the external order disorder cycle
2:16:59
created the conditions for a catastrophic war and laid the groundwork for a new world order. While the stories
2:17:06
from this period are very interesting in and of themselves, they are especially important because they provide lessons
2:17:12
that help us think about what is happening now and what might be ahead. Most importantly, the United States and
2:17:18
China are in an economic war that could conceivably evolve into a military war. And comparisons between the 1930s and
2:17:26
today provide valuable insights into what might happen and how to avoid a terrible war.
2:17:34
the path to war. To help convey the picture of the 1930s, I will run through the
2:17:40
geopolitical highlights leading up to the official start of the war in Europe in 1939 and the bombing of Pearl Harbor
2:17:47
in 1941. Then I will quickly move through the war and the start of the new world
2:17:52
order in 1945 with the US at the peak of its power.
2:17:57
The global depression that followed the great crash of 1929 led to almost all
2:18:02
countries having big internal conflicts over wealth. This caused them to turn to
2:18:08
more populist, autocratic, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders and policies. These moves were either to
2:18:15
the right or to the left and occurred in varying degrees according to the country's circumstances and the
2:18:21
strengths of their democratic or autocratic traditions. In Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain,
2:18:28
extremely bad economic circumstances and less wellestablished democratic traditions led to extreme internal
2:18:35
conflicts and a turn to populist autocratic leaders of the right, that is, fascists, just as at different
2:18:41
points in time, the Soviet Union and China, which also endured extreme circumstances and had no experience with
2:18:48
democracy, turned to populist autocratic leaders of the left, that is communists.
2:18:54
The US and the UK had much stronger democratic traditions and less severe economic conditions. So they became more
2:19:01
populist and autocratic than they had been, but not nearly as much as other
2:19:08
nations. Germany and Japan. While Germany had previously been
2:19:14
saddled with tremendous reparation debts following World War I, by 1929, it was
2:19:20
beginning to emerge from under their yoke via the Young Plan, which provided for considerable debt relief and the
2:19:26
departure of foreign troops from Germany by 1930. Specific developments and detail
2:19:32
on this period are explained in my book, Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crisis. But the global depression hit
2:19:40
Germany hard, leading to nearly 25% unemployment, massive bankruptcies, and
2:19:45
extensive poverty. As is typical, there was a struggle between populists of the
2:19:51
left, communists, and populists of the right, fascists. Adolf Hitler, the leading populist
2:19:57
fascist, tapped into the mood of national humiliation to build a nationalistic furer, casting the Treaty
2:20:04
of Versailles and the countries that imposed it as the enemy. He created a
2:20:10
25point nationalistic program and rallied support around it. In response
2:20:15
to internal fighting and the desire to restore order, Hitler was appointed chancellor in January 1933, drawing
2:20:22
large support for his Nazi party from industrialists who feared the communists. Two months later, the Nazi
2:20:29
party won the most support and the most seats in the German Parliament, the Reichdog.
2:20:36
Hitler refused to pay any further reparation debts, left the League of Nations, and took autocratic control of
2:20:42
Germany in 1934. Holding the dual roles of Chancellor and President, he became the
2:20:48
country's supreme leader. In democracies, there are always some laws that allow leaders to grab special
2:20:55
powers. Hitler seized them all. He invoked article 48 of the VHimar
2:21:01
constitution to put an end to many civil rights and suppress political opposition from the communists and forced the
2:21:08
passage of the enabling act which allowed him to pass laws without approval of the Reichto and the
2:21:14
president. He was ruthless against any opposition. He censored or took control
2:21:20
of newspapers and broadcasting companies. Created a secret police force, the Gestapo, to root out and
2:21:26
crush opposition. deprived Jews of their rights of citizenship, seized the Protestant church's finances, and
2:21:33
arrested church officials who opposed him. Declaring the Aryan race superior,
2:21:39
he prohibited non-arans from serving in government. Hitler took that same
2:21:44
autocratic fascist approach to rebuilding Germany's economy, coupled with big fiscal and monetary stimulation
2:21:51
programs. He privatized state-owned businesses and encouraged corporate investment, acting aggressively to raise
2:21:58
Aryan Germans living standards. For example, he set up Volkswagen to make
2:22:03
cars affordable and accessible, and he directed the building of the Ottabon. He
2:22:08
financed this substantially increased government spending by forcing banks to buy government bonds.
2:22:15
The debts that were produced were paid back by the earnings of companies and the central bank, the Reichkes Bank,
2:22:20
monetizing debt. These fiscal policies by and large worked well in achieving
2:22:26
Hitler's goals. This is another example of how borrowing in one's own currency
2:22:31
and increasing one's own debt and deficits can be highly productive if the money borrowed is put into investments
2:22:37
that raise productivity and produce more than enough cash flow to service the debt. Even if it doesn't cover 100% of
2:22:45
the debt service, it can be very cost-effective in achieving the economic goals of the
2:22:50
country. As for the economic effects of these policies, when Hitler came to
2:22:55
power in 1933, the unemployment rate was 25%. By 1938, it was nil. Per capita
2:23:03
income increased by 22% in the 5 years after Hitler took power and real growth
2:23:08
averaged over 8% per year between 1934 and 1938. As shown in the next PDF charts,
2:23:16
German equities rallied nearly 70% in a steady trend between 1933 and 1938 until
2:23:24
the onset of the hot war. In 1935, Hitler began to build the
2:23:30
military, making military service compulsory for Aryans. Germany's military spending
2:23:36
increased much faster than any other country because the German economy needed more resources to fuel itself and
2:23:43
it intended to use its military power to seize them. Like Germany, Japan was also hit
2:23:50
exceptionally hard by the depression and became more autocratic in response.
2:23:55
Japan was especially vulnerable to the depression because as an island nation without adequate natural resources, it
2:24:02
relied on exports for income to import necessities. When its exports fell by
2:24:08
around 50% between 1929 and 1931, Japan was economically
2:24:14
devastated. In 1931, Japan went broke. That is, it was forced to draw down its
2:24:20
gold reserves, abandon the gold standard, and float its currency, which depreciated it so greatly that Japan ran
2:24:27
out of buying power. These terrible conditions and large wealth gaps led to
2:24:32
fighting between the left and the right. By 1932, there was a massive upsurge in
2:24:38
right-wing nationalism and militarism in the hope that order and economic stability could be forcibly restored.
2:24:45
Japan set out to get the natural resources, for example, oil, iron, coal, and rubber, and human resources, that is
2:24:52
slave labor, it needed by seizing them from other countries, invading Manuria
2:24:58
in 1931 and spreading out through China and Asia. As with Germany, it could be
2:25:04
argued that Japan's path of military aggression to get needed resources was more cost effective than relying on
2:25:10
classic trading and economic practices. In 1934, there was severe famine in
2:25:17
parts of Japan, causing even more political turbulence and reinforcing the right-wing militaristic, nationalistic,
2:25:24
and expansionistic movement. In the years that followed, Japan's top-down fascist command economy
2:25:31
grew stronger, building a military-industrial complex to protect its existing bases in East Asia and
2:25:38
northern China and support its excursions into other countries. As was also the case in Germany, while most
2:25:44
Japanese companies remained privately held, their production was controlled by the
2:25:51
government. What is fascism? Consider the following three big choices that a
2:25:56
country has to make when selecting its approach to governance. One, bottomup
2:26:02
democratic or top-down autocratic decision-making. Two, capitalist or communist with
2:26:10
socialist in the middle ownership of production. And three, individualistic,
2:26:15
which treats the well-being of the individual with paramount importance, or collectivist, which treats the
2:26:21
well-being of the whole with paramount importance. Pick the one from each category that you believe is optimal for
2:26:28
your nation's values and ambitions, and you have your preferred approach.
2:26:34
Fascism is autocratic, capitalist, and collectivist. Fascists believe that
2:26:39
top-down autocratic leadership in which the government directs the production of privately held companies such that
2:26:46
individual gratification is subordinated to national success is the best way to
2:26:51
make the country and its people wealthier and more powerful. The US and the
2:26:59
allies. In the US, debt problems became ruinous for American banks after 1929,
2:27:05
which curtailed their lending around the world, hurting international borrowers.
2:27:10
At the same time, the depression created weak demand, which led to a collapse of US imports and other countries sales to
2:27:17
the US. As incomes weakened, demand fell and more credit problems occurred in a
2:27:23
self-reinforcing downward economic spiral. The US responded by turning
2:27:29
protectionist to safeguard jobs, raising tariffs via the passage of the Smoot Holly Tariff Act in 1930, which further
2:27:37
depressed economic conditions in other countries. Raising tariffs to protect
2:27:42
domestic businesses and jobs during bad economic times is common, but it leads
2:27:48
to reduced efficiency because production does not occur where it can be done most efficiently.
2:27:54
Ultimately, tariffs contribute to greater global economic weakness as tariff wars cause the countries that
2:28:00
impose them to lose exports. Tariffs do, however, benefit the entities that are
2:28:06
protected by them and they can create political support for the leaders who impose them.
2:28:12
The Soviet Union had yet to recover from its devastating 1917-22 revolution and civil war, a lost
2:28:20
war to Germany, a costly war with Poland, and a famine in 1921. And it was racked by political
2:28:27
purges and economic hardships throughout the 1930s. China also suffered from civil
2:28:33
war, poverty, and a famine in 1928 to30. So when things worsened in 1930 and
2:28:40
tariffs began, bad conditions became desperate conditions in those countries. To make matters worse, there
2:28:48
were droughts in the US and in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Harmful acts of nature, for
2:28:54
example, droughts, floods, and plagues often cause periods of great economic hardship that when combined with other
2:29:01
adverse conditions lead to periods of great conflict. In combination with extreme government
2:29:08
policies, millions died in the USSR. At the same time, internal
2:29:13
political fighting and fears of Nazi Germany led to purges of hundreds of thousands of people who were accused of
2:29:20
spying and shot without trials. Deflationary depressions are
2:29:26
debt crises caused by there not being enough money in the hands of debtors to service their debts. They inevitably
2:29:33
lead to the printing of money. debt restructurings and government spending programs that increase the supply of and
2:29:39
reduce the value of money and credit. The only question is how long it takes
2:29:45
for government officials to make this move. In the case of the US, it took 3
2:29:50
and 1/2 years from the crash in October 1929 until President Franklin D.
2:29:55
Roosevelt's March 1933 actions. In Roosevelt's first 100 days in office, he
2:30:02
created several massive government spending programs that were paid for by big tax increases and big budget
2:30:08
deficits financed by debt that the Federal Reserve monetized. He instituted jobs programs,
2:30:15
unemployment insurance, social security, and labor and unionfriendly programs.
2:30:21
After his 1935 tax bill, then popularly called the Soak the rich tax, the top
2:30:27
marginal income tax rate for individuals rose to 75% versus as low as 25% in 1930. By
2:30:37
1941, the top personal tax rate was 81% and the top corporate tax rate was 31%
2:30:44
having started at 12% in 1930. Roosevelt also imposed a number of other
2:30:50
taxes. Despite all of these taxes and the pickup in the economy that helped raise tax revenue, budget deficits
2:30:58
increased from around 1% of GDP to about 4% of GDP because the spending increases
2:31:04
were so large. Specific developments through the Great Depression are explained in great detail in my book,
2:31:11
Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crisis. From 1933 until the end of 1936,
2:31:18
the stock market returned over 200%. And the economy grew at a blistering average
2:31:23
real rate of about 9%. In 1936, the Federal Reserve
2:31:28
tightened money and credit to fight inflation and slow an overheating economy, which caused the fragile US
2:31:35
economy to fall back into recession and the other major economies to weaken with it, further raising tensions within and
2:31:42
between countries. Meanwhile, in Europe, the conflict in Spain between the populists of the left,
2:31:49
the communists, and the populists of the right, the fascists, flared into the brutal Spanish civil war. Right-wing
2:31:57
Franco, with the support of Hitler, succeeded in purging left-wing opposition in
2:32:03
Spain. During periods of severe economic distress and large wealth gaps, there
2:32:08
are typically revolutionarily large redistributions of wealth. When done peacefully, these are achieved through
2:32:15
large tax increases on the rich and big increases in the supply of money that devalue debtors claims. And when done
2:32:22
violently, they are achieved by forced asset confiscations. In the US and the UK,
2:32:29
while there were redistributions of wealth and political power, capitalism and democracy were maintained. In
2:32:36
Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain, they were not. Before there is a shooting war,
2:32:42
there is usually an economic war. As is also typical before allout wars are
2:32:48
declared, there is about a decade of economic, technological, geopolitical, and capital wars during which the
2:32:54
conflicting powers intimidate each other, testing the limits of each other's power. While 1939 and 1941 are
2:33:03
known as the official starts of the wars in Europe and the Pacific, the conflicts
2:33:08
really began about 10 years before that. In addition to the economically motivated conflicts within countries and
2:33:15
the political shifts that arose from them, all of these countries faced increased external economic conflicts as
2:33:22
they fought for greater shares of a shrinking economic pie. Because power and not law rules international
2:33:29
relations, Germany and Japan became more expansionist and increasingly began to test the UK, the US and France in the
2:33:37
competition over resources and influence over territories. Before going on to describe
2:33:44
the hot war, I want to elaborate on the common tactics used when economic and
2:33:49
capital tools are weaponized. They have been and still are.
2:33:55
One, asset freezes and seizures. Preventing an enemy or rival
2:34:00
from using or selling foreign assets they rely on. These measures can range from asset freezes for targeted groups
2:34:07
in a country, for example, the current US sanctions of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard or the initial US
2:34:14
asset freeze against Japan in World War II to more severe measures like unilateral debt repudiation or outright
2:34:22
seizures of a country's assets. For example, some top US policy makers have
2:34:27
been talking about not paying our debts to China. Two, blocking capital markets
2:34:34
access. Preventing a country from accessing their own or another country's capital markets. For example, in 1887,
2:34:42
Germany banned the purchase of Russian securities and debt to impede Russia's military buildup. The US is now
2:34:49
threatening to do this to China. Three, embargos and
2:34:55
blockades. Blockading trade in goods and/or services in one's own country and
2:35:00
in some cases with neutral third parties for the purpose of weakening the targeted country or preventing it from
2:35:07
getting essential items. for example, the US's oil embargo on Japan and
2:35:12
cutting off its ship's access to the Panama Canal in World War II, or blocking exports from the targeted
2:35:19
country to other countries, thus cutting off their income. For example, France's
2:35:24
blockade of the UK in the Napoleonic Wars. If you're interested in seeing how
2:35:29
these tactics have been applied from 1600 until now, they are available at
2:35:35
economicprinciples.org. The hot war
2:35:42
begins. In November 1937, Hitler secretly met with his top
2:35:47
officials to announce his plans for German expansion to gain resources and bring together the Aryan race. Then he
2:35:55
put them into action. First annexing Austria and then seizing a part of what was then Czechoslovakia that contained
2:36:02
oil resources. Europe and the US watched wearily. not wanting to get drawn into
2:36:08
another war so soon after the devastation of World War I. As with all wars, the unknowns were
2:36:16
far greater than the known because a rival powers go into wars only when
2:36:21
their powers are roughly comparable. Otherwise, it would be stupidly suicidal for the obviously weaker power. And B,
2:36:29
there are way too many possible actions and reactions to anticipate.
2:36:34
The only thing that is known at the outset of a hot war is that it will probably be extremely painful and
2:36:40
possibly ruinous. As a result, smart leaders typically go into them only if the other
2:36:46
side has pushed them into a position of either fighting or losing by backing down. For the Allies, that moment came
2:36:54
on September 1st, 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. Germany looked
2:37:00
unstoppable. In short order, it captured Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands,
2:37:05
Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, and strengthened its alliances with Japan and Italy, which had common enemies and
2:37:12
were ideologically aligned. By seizing territory rapidly, for example, oil rich
2:37:18
Romania, Hitler's army was able to conserve its existing oil resources and gain new ones quickly. The thirst for
2:37:26
and acquisition of natural resources remained a major driver of the Nazi war
2:37:31
machine as it pushed its campaigns into Russia and the Middle East. War with the
2:37:36
Soviets was inevitable. The only question was when. Although Germany and
2:37:42
the USSR had signed a non-aggression pact, Germany invaded Russia in June
2:37:48
1941, which put Germany in an extremely costly war on two fronts.
2:37:54
In the Pacific, in 1937, Japan expanded its occupation of China, brutally taking
2:38:00
control of Shanghai and Nangqing, killing an estimated 200,000 Chinese
2:38:06
civilians and disarmed combatants in the capture of Nank King alone. While the US
2:38:12
remained isolationist, it did provide Chiang Kai-sheks government with fighter planes and pilots to counter the
2:38:18
Japanese, putting a toe in the war. Conflicts between the US and Japan began
2:38:23
to flare. A Japanese soldier struck the US consul John Moore Allison in the face
2:38:29
in Nank King and Japanese fighter planes sank a US gunship. In November 1940, Roosevelt won
2:38:38
reelection after campaigning on the promise to keep the US out of the war. Even though the US was already taking
2:38:45
economic actions to protect its interests, especially in the Pacific, using economic supports to help
2:38:51
countries it sympathized with and economic sanctions against those it did not. Earlier in 1940, Secretary of War
2:38:59
Henry Stimson had initiated aggressive economic sanctions against Japan,
2:39:04
culminating in the Export Control Act of 1940. In mid 1940, the US moved the US
2:39:11
Pacific fleet to Hawaii. In October, the US ramped up the embargo, restricting
2:39:17
all iron and steel to destinations other than Britain and nations of the Western
2:39:23
Hemisphere. The plan was to cut Japan off from resources in order to force them to retreat from most of the areas
2:39:30
they had taken over. In March 1941, Congress passed the Lend
2:39:36
Lease Act, which allowed the US to lend or lease war supplies to the nations it
2:39:41
deemed to be acting in ways that were vital to the defense of the United States, which included Great Britain,
2:39:47
the Soviet Union, and China. Helping the Allies was good for the US both
2:39:53
geopolitically and economically because it made a lot of money selling weapons, food, and other items to these
2:39:59
soon-to-be Allied countries who were struggling to maintain production while waging war. But its motivations weren't
2:40:06
entirely mercenary. Great Britain was running out of money, that is gold. So
2:40:12
the US allowed them to postpone payment until after the war. In some cases
2:40:17
waving payment entirely, although not an outright declaration of war, lend lease
2:40:23
effectively ended the United States neutrality. When countries are weak,
2:40:28
opposing countries take advantage of their weaknesses to obtain gains. France, the Netherlands, and
2:40:35
Great Britain all had colonies in Asia. overstretched by the fighting in Europe,
2:40:40
they were unable to defend them against the Japanese. Starting in September 1940,
2:40:46
Japan invaded several colonies in Southeast Asia, beginning with French Indochina, adding what it called the
2:40:53
Southern Resource Zone to its greater East Asia co-rossperity sphere. In 1941,
2:41:00
Japan seized oil reserves in the Dutch East Indies. This Japanese territorial expansion was
2:41:07
a threat to the US's own Pacific ambitions. In July and August 1941,
2:41:13
Roosevelt responded by freezing all Japanese assets in the United States, closing the Panama Canal to Japanese
2:41:20
ships and embargoing oil and gas exports to Japan. This cut off 3/4s of Japan's
2:41:26
trade and 80% of its oil. Japan calculated that it would run out of oil
2:41:32
in 2 years. This put Japan in the position of having to choose between backing down or attacking the US. On
2:41:40
December 7th and 8th, 1941, Japan launched coordinated attacks on US
2:41:45
military forces at Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines. This marked the beginning of the declared war in the
2:41:52
Pacific, which brought the US into the war in Europe, too. While Japan didn't
2:41:57
have a widely recognized plan to win the war, the most optimistic Japanese
2:42:02
leaders believed that the US would lose because it was fighting a war on two fronts and because its individualistic
2:42:09
capitalist political system was inferior to Japan's and Germany's authoritarian
2:42:15
fascist systems with their command militaryindustrial complexes.
2:42:20
They also believed that they had the greater willingness to endure pain and die for their country, which is a big
2:42:26
driver of which side wins. In war, one's ability to withstand
2:42:32
pain is even more important than one's ability to inflict
2:42:38
pain. Wartime economic policies. Just as it is worth noting
2:42:44
what classic economic war tactics are, it is also worth noting what classic wartime economic policies are within
2:42:51
countries. These include government controls on just about everything as the country shifts its resources from
2:42:58
profitm to war making. For example, the government determines A, what items are
2:43:03
allowed to be produced. B what items can be bought and sold in what amounts rationing.
2:43:10
C. What items can be imported and exported? D. Prices, wages, and profits.
2:43:17
E, access to one's own financial assets. And F, the ability to move one's own
2:43:23
money out of the country. Because wars are expensive, classically, the
2:43:28
government G issues lots of debt that is monetized. H relies on nonredit money
2:43:35
such as gold for international transactions because its credit is not accepted. I governs more
2:43:42
autocratically. J imposes various types of economic sanctions on enemies
2:43:47
including cutting off their access to capital and K experiences enemies imposing these sanctions on
2:43:54
them. When the US entered the European and Pacific Wars after the attack on Pearl Harbor, classic wartime economic
2:44:02
policies were put in place in most countries by leaders whose more autocratic approaches were broadly
2:44:08
supported by their populations. The attached PDF table, wartime economic controls, shows
2:44:16
economic controls in each of the major countries. The market movements during the hot war
2:44:22
years were heavily affected by both government controls and how countries did in battles as the odds of winning
2:44:29
and losing changed. The next PDF table shows the controls over markets and
2:44:34
capital flows that were put in place by the major countries during the war years. Stock market closures were common
2:44:42
in a number of countries, leaving investors in stocks stuck without access to their capital. I should also note
2:44:49
that money and credit were not commonly accepted between non-allied countries during the war because of a justifiable
2:44:56
weariness about whether the currency would have any value. As noted earlier, gold or in some cases silver or barter
2:45:05
is the coin of the realm during wars. At such times, prices and capital flows are
2:45:10
typically controlled. So it is difficult to say what the real prices of many things
2:45:16
are because losing wars typically leads to a total wipeout of wealth and power.
2:45:22
Movements of those stock markets that remained open in the war years were largely driven by how countries did in
2:45:28
key battles as these results shifted the probability of victory or defeat for each side.
2:45:35
For example, German equities outperformed at the beginning of World War II as Germany captured territory and
2:45:41
established military dominance, while they underperformed after Allied powers like the US and the UK turned the tide
2:45:49
of the war. After the 1942 Battle of Midway, Allied equities rallied almost
2:45:55
continuously until the end of the war, while Axis equities were flat or down.
2:46:01
As shown in the next PDF chart, equity return index. Both the German and
2:46:07
Japanese stock markets were closed at the end of the war, didn't reopen for around 5 years, and were virtually wiped
2:46:14
out when they did, while US stocks were extremely strong.
2:46:19
Protecting one's wealth in times of war is difficult as normal economic activities are curtailed. Traditionally,
2:46:26
safe investments are not safe, capital mobility is limited, and high taxes are
2:46:31
imposed when people and countries are fighting for their survival. Protecting the wealth of those who have it is not a
2:46:38
priority relative to the need to redistribute wealth to get it to where it is needed most. As for investing,
2:46:45
sell out of all debt and buy gold because wars are financed by borrowing and printing money which devalues debt
2:46:52
and money and because there is a justifiable reluctance to accept
2:46:59
credit. Conclusion. Every world power has its
2:47:04
time in the sun thanks to the uniqueness of their circumstances and the nature of their character and culture. For
2:47:11
example, they have the essential elements of a strong work ethic, smarts, discipline, education, etc., but they
2:47:18
all eventually decline. Some do so more gracefully than others with less trauma, but they
2:47:24
nevertheless decline. Traumatic declines can lead to some of the worst periods in
2:47:30
history when big fights over wealth and power prove extremely costly both economically and in human
2:47:37
lives. Still, the cycle needn't transpire this way. If countries in their rich and powerful stages stay
2:47:44
productive, earn more than they spend, make the system work well for most of their populations, and figure out ways
2:47:51
of creating and sustaining win-win relationships with their most significant rivals. A number of empires
2:47:58
and dynasties have sustained themselves for hundreds of years, and the United States at 245 years old has proven
2:48:05
itself to be one of the longest lasting. In part two, I will turn to the
2:48:10
US, to the two reserve currency empires that preceded it, and the one that may
2:48:15
someday follow it. As we continue, I hope this explanation of the archetypical big cycle and the three
2:48:22
cycles that make it up will help you see the patterns of history and what they
2:48:27
pretend. But before we delve more deeply into the history, I'd first like to share how these big three cycles figure
2:48:34
into my approach as an investor. Chapter 7. Investing in light of the big
Chapter 7: Investing in Light of the Big Cycle
2:48:42
cycle. The game I play for handling both my life and my career is to try to
2:48:48
figure out how the world works, develop principles for dealing with it well, and then place my bets. The research that
2:48:55
I'm sharing with you in this book was done for that purpose. Naturally, when I look at all that we've covered up to
2:49:01
this point, I think about how it applies to my investing. For me to be comfortable that I am doing that well, I
2:49:08
need to know how my approach would have worked through time. If I can't confidently explain what happened in the
2:49:14
past, or at least have a strategy for dealing with it in light of what I don't know, I consider myself dangerously
2:49:22
negligent. As you saw from my study of the last 500 years up to now, there were
2:49:27
big cycles of great accumulations and great losses of wealth and power. And of these, the greatest contributing factor
2:49:35
was the debt and capital markets cycle. From an investor's perspective, this
2:49:40
could be called the big investing cycle. I felt that I needed to understand these cycles well enough to tactically move or
2:49:47
diversify my portfolio to be protected against them and/or to profit from them.
2:49:53
By understanding them and ideally realizing where countries are in their cycles, I can do that. Over my roughly
2:50:01
50 years as a global macro investor, I discovered many timeless and universal
2:50:07
truths that form my principles for investing. While I won't get deeply into all of them here, but will discuss most
2:50:14
of them in my next book, principles, economics, and investing, I will convey one important
2:50:20
principle. All markets are primarily driven by just four determinants.
2:50:25
Growth, inflation, risk premiums, and discount rates.
2:50:31
That is because all investments are exchanges of lumpsum payments today for future payments. What these future cash
2:50:38
payments will be is determined by growth in inflation. What risk investors are willing to take in investing in them as
2:50:45
compared to having cash in hand is the risk premium and what they are worth today which is called their present
2:50:52
value is determined by the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate
2:50:57
that one uses to assess what an amount of money in the future is worth today.
2:51:02
To calculate it, one compares what amount of money today invested at that interest rate, that is the discount
2:51:09
rate, would be worth a certain amount at a specific time in the future. How these four determinants
2:51:16
change drives how investment returns change. Tell me what each of these determinants is going to do and I can
2:51:22
tell you what the investments are going to do. Knowing this tells me how to connect what is happening in the world
2:51:28
to what is happening in the markets and vice versa. It also shows me how to balance my investments so that my
2:51:35
portfolio doesn't have any bias to any environment which is what produces good
2:51:40
diversification. Governments influence these factors through their fiscal and monetary policies. As a result,
2:51:47
interactions between what governments want to happen and what is actually happening are what drive the cycles. If
2:51:54
governments and their systems break down, non-government directed forces take over, which is a whole other story
2:52:00
that I won't get into now. For example, when growth and inflation are too low, central banks create more
2:52:07
money and credit growth, which creates buying power, which causes economic growth to pick up at first, and then
2:52:14
with a lag, inflation to pick up as well. When central banks constrain money
2:52:19
and credit growth, the opposite happens. Economic growth and inflation both slow down. There is a difference between what
2:52:27
central governments and central banks do in order to drive market returns and economic conditions. Central governments
2:52:34
determine where the money they use comes from and goes to because they can tax and spend, but they can't create money
2:52:41
and credit. Central banks, on the other hand, can create money and credit, but can't determine what the money and
2:52:48
credit go into in the real economy. These actions from central governments and central banks influence the
2:52:54
purchases and sales of goods, services, and investment assets, driving their prices up or
2:53:01
down. To me, each investment asset reflects these drivers in its own way
2:53:06
that is logical in light of the effects on its future cash flows. Each investment asset is a building block for
2:53:13
a portfolio. And the challenge is to put together a portfolio well in light of these things. For example, when growth
2:53:20
is stronger than expected, all else being equal, stock prices will likely rise. And when growth and inflation are
2:53:27
higher than expected, bond prices will likely fall. My goal is to put these
2:53:32
building blocks together in a portfolio that is well diversified and tactically tilted based on what is happening or is
2:53:39
going to happen in the world that is affecting these four drivers. These building blocks can be broken out
2:53:46
by country, by environmental bias, and all the way down to the level of individual sectors and companies. When
2:53:52
this concept is put into a well-balanced portfolio, it looks like the next PDF graphic titled the building blocks of a
2:53:59
well- diversified portfolio. It is through this lens that I look at the history of events, the
2:54:06
history of the markets, and the behavior of portfolios. I understand that my approach is
2:54:12
different from that of most investors for two reasons. First, most investors don't look for historically analogous
2:54:19
periods because they think history and old investment returns are largely irrelevant to them. Second, they don't
2:54:26
look at investment returns through the lens I just described. I believe that these perspectives give me and
2:54:32
Bridgewwater a competitive advantage, but it's up to you to take or leave them as you like.
2:54:38
Most investors base their expectations on what they have experienced in their lifetimes and a few more diligent ones
2:54:45
look back in history to see how their decision-making rules would have worked back to the 1950s or
2:54:51
1960s. There are no investors I know and no senior economic policy makers I know
2:54:57
and I know many and I know the best who have any excellent understandings of what happened in the past and why. Most
2:55:05
investors who look at longerterm returns, look at those in the US and the UK, the countries that won World War I
2:55:12
and World War II, as being representative. That is because there are not many stock and bond markets that
2:55:18
survived World War II. But these countries and time periods are not representative because of their
2:55:24
survivorship bias. In looking at the returns of the US and the UK, one is
2:55:30
looking at uniquely blessed countries in the uniquely peaceful and productive time that is the best part of the big
2:55:36
cycle. Not looking at what happened in other countries and in times before yields a distorted
2:55:43
perspective. Reasoning logically from what we know about big cycles. When we extend our perspective just a few
2:55:50
decades further back and look at what happened in different places, we get a shockingly different perspective. I'm
2:55:57
going to show you this because I think you should have it. In the 35 years before
2:56:03
1945, virtually all wealth was destroyed or confiscated in most countries. And in
2:56:09
some countries, many capitalists were killed or imprisoned because of anger at them when the capital markets and
2:56:15
capitalism failed along with other aspects of the old order. If we look at
2:56:20
what happened over the past few centuries, we see that such extreme boom bust cycles happened regularly. There
2:56:27
were regular cycles of capital and capitalist boom periods such as the second industrial revolution and the
2:56:33
guilded age that happened in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that were followed by transition periods like the
2:56:40
1900 to 1910 period of rising internal conflict and rising international
2:56:46
conflict over wealth and power that led to great conflict and economic bust
2:56:51
periods similar to those that happened between 1910 and 1945.
2:56:57
We can also see that the cause effect relationships that were behind the movements of those boom and bust periods
2:57:03
are now more aligned with the late cycle bust and restructuring periods than the
2:57:08
early cycle boom and building periods. My goal was simply to see and
2:57:14
try to understand what happened in the past and do a good job of showing it to you. That is what I will now try to do.
2:57:22
I will start in 1350, though the story begins long
2:57:28
before. The big cycle of capitalism and markets. Up until around 1350, lending
2:57:36
with an interest rate was prohibited by both Christianity and Islam. And in Judaism, it was banned within the Jewish
2:57:43
community because of the terrible problems it caused with human nature leading people to borrow more than they
2:57:49
could pay back, which created tensions and often violence between borrowers and lenders. As a result of this lack of
2:57:57
lending, currency was hard, gold and silver. A century or so later, in the
2:58:03
age of exploration, explorers went around the world collecting gold and silver and other hard assets to make
2:58:09
more money. That's how the greatest fortunes were built at the time. The explorers and those who backed them
2:58:16
split the profits. It was an effective incentive-based system for getting rich.
2:58:22
The alchemy of lending as we know it today was first created in Italy around 1350.
2:58:28
Rules for lending changed and new types of money were made. Cash deposits, bonds, and stocks that looked pretty
2:58:35
much like we know them today. Wealth became promises to deliver money. What I
2:58:40
call financial wealth. Think about what a huge impact the inventions and developments of bond
2:58:47
and stock markets had. Before then, all wealth was tangible. Think about how
2:58:53
much more financial wealth was created by creating these markets. To imagine
2:58:58
the difference, consider how much wealth you would now have if your cash deposits and stock and bond promises to pay you
2:59:05
in the future didn't exist. You wouldn't have much at all. You'd feel broke and
2:59:10
you'd behave differently. For example, you'd build up more savings and tangible wealth. That is pretty much what it was
2:59:17
like before cash deposits, bonds, and stocks were created. With the invention and growth
2:59:24
of financial wealth, money was not constrained by a link to gold and silver. Because money and credit and
2:59:31
with them spending power were less constrained, it was common practice for entrepreneurs who came up with good
2:59:37
ideas to create companies and borrow money and/or sell a piece of those companies by selling stock to get money
2:59:44
to buy what they needed. They could do this because promises to pay became
2:59:49
money that took the form of journal entries. Around 1350, those who could do
2:59:54
this, most famously the Meduche family in Florence, could create money. If you
3:00:00
can create credit, let's say five times as much as there is actual money, which
3:00:05
banks can do, you can produce a lot of buying power, so you don't need as much of the other type of money, gold and
3:00:11
silver, anymore. The creation of new forms of money was and still is a kind
3:00:17
of alchemy. Those who could create it and use it, bankers, entrepreneurs and capitalists, became very rich and
3:00:25
powerful. You can see this kind of alchemy at work today in the form of digital
3:00:30
currency. This process of expanding financial wealth has continued up to today with financial wealth becoming so
3:00:38
large that the hard money, gold and silver and other tangible wealth, for example, property have become relatively
3:00:44
unimportant. But of course, the more promises there are in the form of financial wealth, the greater the risk
3:00:51
there is that these promises can't be kept. That's what makes the classic big debt money economic cycle. Think about
3:00:58
how much financial wealth there is now relative to real wealth. And imagine if you and others who were holding it
3:01:05
actually tried to convert it into real wealth, that is sell it and buy stuff.
3:01:10
It would be like a run on a bank. It couldn't happen. The bonds and stocks are too sizable in value relative to
3:01:17
what they could buy. But remember that with fiat money, the central banks can print and provide the money needed to
3:01:24
meet the demand. That is a timeless and universal truth. Also remember that paper money
3:01:31
and financial assets, for example, stocks and bonds that are essentially promises to pay aren't of much use. It
3:01:38
is only what they buy that is of use. As discussed in detail in chapter
3:01:44
3, when credit is created, buying power is created in exchange for a promise to
3:01:49
pay back. So, it is near-term stimulating and longerterm depressing.
3:01:55
That creates cycles. Throughout history, the desire to obtain money by borrowing
3:02:00
or selling stock and the desire to save it by investing through lending or buying stock have been in a symbiotic
3:02:08
relationship. This has led to growth in the form of buying power and eventually to many more
3:02:14
promises to pay than can be delivered and broken promises crisis in the form of debt default depressions and stock
3:02:21
market crashes. That is when the bankers and capitalists are hanged both figuratively
3:02:27
and literally. Vast amounts of wealth and lives are wiped out. And vast amounts of fiat money, money that can be
3:02:35
printed and has no intrinsic value, are printed to try to relieve the [Music]
3:02:41
crisis. The more complete picture of the big cycle from an investor's perspective.
3:02:48
While it would be too burdensome for me and you to go through all the relevant history between 1350 and now, I will
3:02:56
show you what the picture would have looked like if you had started investing in 1900. But before I do so, I want to
3:03:03
explain how I think about risk because I'm going to highlight these risks in what I show you. As I see it, investment
3:03:10
risk is failing to earn enough money to meet your needs. It's not volatility
3:03:15
measured by standard deviation, which is the almost exclusively used measure of risk. To me, the three biggest risks
3:03:23
most investors face are that their portfolios won't provide the returns needed to meet their spending needs,
3:03:30
that their portfolios will face ruin, and that a large share of their wealth will be taken away, for example, through
3:03:37
high taxes. While the first two risks sound analogous, they are in fact
3:03:42
different because it is possible to have average returns that are higher than required but also experience one or more
3:03:49
periods of devastatingly high losses. To gain perspective, I imagined
3:03:54
that I was dropped into 1900 to see how my investments would have done in every decade since. I chose to look at the 10
3:04:02
greatest powers as of 1900 and skip less established countries which were more
3:04:07
prone to bad outcomes. Virtually any one of these countries was or could have
3:04:13
become a great wealthy empire and they were all reasonable places for one to invest, especially if one wanted to have
3:04:20
a diversified portfolio. Seven of these 10 countries saw wealth virtually wiped out at least
3:04:27
once. And even the countries that didn't see wealth wiped out had a handful of terrible decades for asset returns that
3:04:34
virtually destroyed them financially. Two of the great developed countries, Germany and Japan, which at
3:04:40
times one easily could have bet on as being winners, had virtually all their wealth and many lives destroyed in the
3:04:48
world wars. I saw that many other countries had similar results. the US
3:04:53
and the UK and a few others were the uniquely successful cases, but even they experienced periods of great wealth
3:05:01
destruction. If I hadn't looked at these returns in the period before the new world order began in
3:05:07
1945, I wouldn't have seen these periods of destruction. And had I not looked
3:05:12
back 500 years around the world, I wouldn't have seen that this has happened repeatedly almost everywhere.
3:05:19
The numbers shown in the next PDF table, a look at asset returns across the great
3:05:24
powers, are annualized real returns for each decade, which means that for the decade as a whole, the losses are about
3:05:32
8 times greater than shown and the gains are about 15 times greater. When
3:05:38
compounded over a decade, gains are greater than losses because you keep building off of gains. Whereas as you
3:05:44
experience losses and approach zero, future percent losses matter less in dollar terms. The comparison of
3:05:52
annualizing gains versus losses represents compounding from 10% annualized gains and -5% annualized
3:06:00
losses on average. At more extreme changes, the multipliers change from there.
3:06:06
Perhaps this next PDF chart paints a clearer picture as it shows what percentage of countries saw losses of a
3:06:13
6040 stock bond portfolio over 5-year periods. The next PDF table shows the
3:06:21
worst cases of investing in major countries in detail. You will note that the US doesn't appear on this table
3:06:28
because it wasn't among the worst cases. The US, Canada, and Australia were the
3:06:33
only countries that didn't experience sustained periods of losses. Naturally, I think about how I
3:06:40
would have approached these periods if I had been living through them. I'm certain that even if I had seen the
3:06:46
signs of things coming that I'm passing along in this book, I never would have confidently predicted such bad outcomes.
3:06:53
As noted earlier, seven of 10 countries saw their wealth wiped out in the early
3:06:59
1900s. Even those looking back over the past few decades would never have seen it coming because there were plenty of
3:07:05
reasons to be optimistic based on what had happened during the second half of the 19th century. People today often assume that
3:07:13
World War I must have been easy to foresee in the years leading up to it, but that wasn't the case. Before the
3:07:20
war, there had been about 50 years of almost no conflict between the world's major powers. During those 50 years, the
3:07:27
world experienced the greatest innovation and productivity growth rates it had ever seen, which led to enormous
3:07:33
wealth and prosperity. Globalization was at new highs with global exports up several
3:07:39
multiples in the 50 years prior to World War I. Countries were more interconnected than ever. The US,
3:07:46
France, Germany, Japan, and AustriaHungary were rapidly rising empires experiencing dizzying
3:07:53
technological advancement. The UK was still the dominant global power. Russia
3:07:58
was rapidly industrializing. Of those countries shown in the table of worst investor experiences, only China was
3:08:06
obviously in decline. Strong alliances among European powers were seen at the
3:08:11
time as a means of keeping the peace and maintaining the balance of power. Going into 1900, things looked great, except
3:08:19
for the fact that wealth gaps and resentments were increasing and debts had become
3:08:25
large. Between 1900 and 1914, these conditions worsened and international
3:08:31
tensions increased. Then came the periods of terrible returns I just
3:08:36
described. But it was worse than just terrible returns. In addition, the impacts on wealth of
3:08:43
wealth confiscations, confiscatory taxes, capital controls, and markets
3:08:48
being closed were enormous. Most investors today don't know of such things and consider them implausible
3:08:55
because they wouldn't have seen them by looking back on the past few decades. The next PDF table, periods of
3:09:02
wealth confiscation, shows in which decades these events occurred. Naturally, the most severe cases of
3:09:08
wealth confiscation came during periods in which there were large wealth gaps and internal conflict over wealth when
3:09:15
economic conditions got bad and/or there was a war. The next PDF chart shows the share
3:09:22
of major countries that shut their stock markets through time. Wartime stock
3:09:27
market closures were common and of course communist countries shut their stock markets over a generation.
3:09:35
The bad parts of all the cycles that took place prior to 1900 were similarly
3:09:40
bad. To make matters even worse, these periods of internal and external
3:09:45
fighting over wealth and power led to many deaths as shown in the next PDF table.
3:09:52
Even for the lucky investors who were in countries that won the wars, such as the US, which was twice the biggest winner,
3:09:59
there were two further headwinds, market timing and taxes. Most investors sell
3:10:06
near the lows when things are bad because they need money and because they tend to panic. They tend to buy near the
3:10:12
highs because they have plenty of money and they are drawn into the euphoria. This means that their actual returns are
3:10:19
worse than the market returns I showed. A recent study showed that US investors
3:10:25
underperformed US stocks by around 1.5% a year between 2000 and 2020.
3:10:32
As for taxes, the next PDF table estimates the average impact of taxes
3:10:37
for investors in the S&P 500 over all 20-year periods using average tax rates
3:10:43
for the top quintile today throughout the analysis period. The different columns represent
3:10:50
different ways of investing in the US stock market, including a tax deferred retirement account where tax is paid
3:10:56
only at the end of the investment and holding physical equities and reinvesting dividends annually like if
3:11:03
stocks were held in a brokerage account. While these different implementations have different tax implications with
3:11:10
retirement accounts least impacted, all of them show a significant impact, especially in real returns where taxes
3:11:17
can erode a significant portion of returns. US investors lost about a
3:11:23
quarter of their real equity returns on average to taxes in any given 20-year
3:11:28
period. [Music] Reviewing the big capital market
3:11:35
cycle. Earlier I explained how the classic big debt and capital market cycle works. To reiterate in the upwave
3:11:43
debt is increased and financial wealth and obligations rise relative to tangible wealth to the point that these
3:11:50
promises to pay in the future that is the values of cash, bonds and stocks can't be met. This causes run-on the
3:11:58
bank type debt problems to emerge which leads to the printing of money to try to relieve the problems of debt defaults
3:12:05
and falling stock market prices which leads to the devaluation of money and in
3:12:10
turn to financial wealth going down relative to real wealth until the real
3:12:15
inflationadjusted value of financial assets returns to being low relative to
3:12:21
tangible wealth. Then the cycle begins again. That is a very simplified
3:12:27
description, but you get the idea. During the downwave in this cycle, there are negative real returns of financial
3:12:33
assets relative to real assets and there are bad times. It is the anti- capital
3:12:40
anti- capitalist part of the cycle that continues until the opposite extreme is
3:12:45
reached. This cycle is reflected in the next two PDF charts. The first shows the
3:12:52
value of total financial assets relative to the total value of real assets. The
3:12:58
second shows the real return of money that is cash. I use US numbers rather
3:13:04
than global numbers because they are the ones that are most continuous since 1900. As you can see, when there is a
3:13:10
lot of financial wealth relative to real wealth, it reverses and real returns of financial wealth, especially cash and
3:13:18
debt assets like bonds are bad. That is because interest rates and returns for
3:13:23
debt holders have to be low and bad in order to provide the relief to the debtors who have too much debt and in
3:13:30
order to try to stimulate more debt growth as a way of stimulating the economy. This is the classic late cycle
3:13:37
part of the long-term debt cycle. It occurs when printing more money is used to reduce debt burdens and new debts are
3:13:45
created to increase purchasing power. This devalues the currency relative to
3:13:50
other storeholds of wealth and relative to goods and services. Eventually, as the value of financial
3:13:57
assets declines until they become cheap relative to real assets, the opposite
3:14:02
extreme is reached and reverses, which is when peace and prosperity return, the
3:14:07
cycle goes into its up phase, and financial assets have excellent real
3:14:13
returns. As explained earlier, during periods of the devaluation of money,
3:14:18
hard money and hard assets rise in value relative to cash. For example, the next
3:14:24
PDF chart shows that periods when the value of the classic 60/40 stock bond
3:14:30
portfolio declined were periods when gold prices rose. I'm not saying
3:14:35
anything about gold being a good or bad investment. I'm simply describing economic and market mechanics and how
3:14:42
they have been manifest in past market movements and investment returns for the purpose of sharing my perspective on
3:14:49
what happened and what could happen and why. One of the most important questions
3:14:55
investors need to regularly ask themselves is whether the amount of interest that is being paid more than
3:15:01
makes up for the devaluation risk they face. The classic big debt money capital
3:15:07
market cycle which has repeated through time and in all places and is reflected
3:15:12
in the charts I just showed you is seen in the relative values of one real
3:15:18
tangible money and real tangible wealth and two financial money and financial
3:15:24
wealth. Financial money and financial wealth are valuable only to the extent
3:15:29
that they get you the real money and real wealth that have real that is intrinsic value. The ways these cycles
3:15:37
have always worked is that in their rising phases the amounts of financial money and financial wealth that is
3:15:43
created debt and equity assets are increased relative to the amounts of real money and real wealth that they are
3:15:50
claims on. They are increased because A it is profitable for those capitalists
3:15:56
who are in the business of creating and selling financial assets to produce and sell them. B increasing money, credit
3:16:03
and other capital market assets is an effective way for policymakers to create prosperity because it funds demand. And
3:16:11
C, it creates the illusion that people are wealthier because the stated values of financial investments go up when the
3:16:18
value of the money and debt assets goes down. In this way, central governments
3:16:24
and central bankers have always created many more claims on real money and real
3:16:29
wealth than could ever be turned in for real wealth and real money. In the
3:16:34
rising parts of the cycle, stocks, bonds, and other investment assets go up as interest rates go down because
3:16:41
falling interest rates make asset prices rise, all else being equal. Also,
3:16:47
putting more money in the system raises the demand for financial assets, which lowers risk premiums. When these
3:16:54
investments go up because of lower interest rates and more money in the system, that makes them seem more
3:16:59
attractive at the same time as interest rates and the future expected returns of financial assets are going down. The
3:17:07
more outstanding claims there are relative to what there are claims on, the more risk there is. This should be
3:17:14
compensated for by a higher interest rate, but it typically isn't because at that moment conditions seem good and
3:17:21
memories of debt and capital market crises have faded. The charts that I showed you
3:17:27
before to convey the cycles would not be complete and painting the picture without some interest rate charts.
3:17:34
Interest rates are shown in the next four PDF charts that go back to 1900.
3:17:40
They show real that is inflationadjusted bond yields. Nominal that is
3:17:45
non-inflation adjusted bond yields and nominal and real cash rates for the US,
3:17:51
Europe and Japan at the time of my writing. As you can see, they were much higher and now they are very low. Real
3:17:59
yields of reserve currency sovereign bonds at the time of my writing this are near the lowest ever and nominal bond
3:18:06
yields are around 0% also near the lowest ever as shown real yields of cash
3:18:13
are even lower though not as negative as they were in the 1930 to45 and 1915 to20
3:18:20
great monetization periods. Nominal cash yields are near the lowest ever.
3:18:27
What does this mean for investing? The purpose of investing is to have money in a storehold of wealth that one can
3:18:33
convert into buying power at a later date. When one invests, one gives a
3:18:39
lumpsum payment for payments in the future. Let's look at what that deal as
3:18:44
of this writing looks like. If you give $100 today, how many years do you have
3:18:50
to wait to get your $100 back and then start collecting the reward on top of
3:18:55
what you gave? In US, Japanese, Chinese, and European
3:19:00
bonds, you could have to wait roughly 45 years, 150 years, and 30 years,
3:19:06
respectively, based on August 2021 levels of 30-year nominal bond yields
3:19:11
treated as perpetuity, to get your money back, likely getting low or nil nominal
3:19:17
returns. And in Europe, at the time of this writing, you would likely never get your money back given negative nominal
3:19:24
interest rates. However, because you are trying to store buying power, you have to take into
3:19:30
consideration inflation. At the time of this writing, in the US and Europe, you
3:19:35
may never get your buying power back. And in Japan, it will take over 250
3:19:41
years. In fact, in these countries with negative real interest rates, you are almost guaranteed to have a lot less
3:19:48
buying power in the future. Rather than get paid less than inflation, why not
3:19:54
instead buy stuff, any stuff that will equal inflation or better? I see a lot
3:20:00
of investments that I expect to do significantly better than inflation. The next PDF charts show
3:20:06
these payback periods for holding cash and bonds in the US in both nominal and real terms. As shown, it is the longest
3:20:14
ever and obviously a ridiculous amount of time. [Music]

Conclusion. What I showed you here was the big cycle from an investor's perspective since 1900. In looking
3:20:30
around the world going back 500 years and in China going back 1,400 years, I
3:20:35
saw basically the same cycles occur repeatedly for basically the same reasons. As discussed earlier in the
3:20:42
book, the terrible periods in the years prior to the 1945 establishment of the new world order are typical of the late
3:20:50
big cycle transition stage when revolutionary changes and restructurings occur. While they were terrible, they
3:20:57
were more than matched by terrific upswings that came after the painful transition from the old order to the new
3:21:04
order. Because these things have happened many times before and because I
3:21:09
can't say for sure what will happen in the future, I can't invest without having protections against these sorts
3:21:15
of things happening and my being wrong. That brings us to the end of the chapters covered in this video. To
