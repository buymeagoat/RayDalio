How the economic machine works, in 30 minutes. The economy works like a simple machine.
0:06
But many people don't understand it — or they don't agree on how it works — and this has led to a lot of needless economic suffering.
0:15
I feel a deep sense of responsibility to share my simple but practical economic template.
0:23
Though it's unconventional, it has helped me to anticipate and sidestep the global financial crisis,
0:30
and has worked well for me for over 30 years. Let's begin. Though the economy might seem complex, it works in a simple, mechanical way.
0:39
It's made up of a few simple parts and a lot of simple transactions that are repeated over and over again a zillion times.
0:47
These transactions are above all else driven by human nature, and they create 3 main forces that drive the economy.
0:55
Number 1: Productivity growth Number 2: The Short term debt cycle
1:01
and Number 3: The Long term debt cycle We'll look at these three forces and how laying them on top of each other
1:07
creates a good template for tracking economic movements and figuring out what's happening now.
1:13
Let's start with the simplest part of the economy: Transactions.
1:19
An economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up and a transaction is a very simple thing.
1:26
You make transactions all the time. Every time you buy something you create a transaction.
1:31
Each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit
1:37
with a seller for goods, services or financial assets.
1:42
Credit spends just like money, so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent,
1:49
you can know the total spending. The total amount of spending drives the economy.
1:55
If you divide the amount spent by the quantity sold, you get the price.
2:01
And that's it. That's a transaction. It is the building block of the economic machine.
2:07
All cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions. So, if we can understand transactions,
2:14
we can understand the whole economy. A market consists of all the buyers
2:19
and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing. For example, there is a wheat market,
2:25
a car market, a stock market and markets for millions of things.
2:31
An economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets. If you add up the total spending
2:37
and the total quantity sold in all of the markets, you have everything you need to know to understand the economy.
2:44
It's just that simple. People, businesses, banks and governments all engage in transactions the way I just described:
2:53
exchanging money and credit for goods, services and financial assets.
2:59
The biggest buyer and seller is the government, which consists of two important parts:
3:04
a Central Government that collects taxes and spends money... ...and a Central Bank,
3:09
which is different from other buyers and sellers because it controls the amount of money and credit in the economy.
3:16
It does this by influencing interest rates and printing new money. For these reasons, as we'll see,
3:24
the Central Bank is an important player in the flow of Credit.
3:29
I want you to pay attention to credit. Credit is the most important part of the economy,
3:34
and probably the least understood. It is the most important part because it is the biggest
3:40
and most volatile part. Just like buyers and sellers go to the market to make transactions,
3:47
so do lenders and borrowers. Lenders usually want to make their money into more money
3:53
and borrowers usually want to buy something they can't afford, like a house or car
3:59
or they want to invest in something like starting a business. Credit can help both lenders
4:04
and borrowers get what they want. Borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow,
4:11
called the principal, plus an additional amount, called interest. When interest rates are high,
4:17
there is less borrowing because it's expensive. When interest rates are low, borrowing increases because it's cheaper.
4:25
When borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them, credit is created.
4:31
Any two people can agree to create credit out of thin air! That seems simple enough but credit is tricky
4:39
because it has different names. As soon as credit is created, it immediately turns into debt.
4:46
Debt is both an asset to the lender, and a liability to the borrower.
4:51
In the future, when the borrower repays the loan, plus interest, the asset and liability disappear
4:58
and the transaction is settled. So, why is credit so important?
5:05
Because when a borrower receives credit, he is able to increase his spending. And remember, spending drives the economy.
5:13
This is because one person's spending is another person's income. Think about it, every dollar you spend, someone else earns.
5:22
and every dollar you earn, someone else has spent. So when you spend more, someone else earns more.
5:29
When someone's income rises it makes lenders more willing to lend him money
5:34
because now he's more worthy of credit. A creditworthy borrower has two things:
5:40
the ability to repay and collateral. Having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay.
5:49
In the event that he can't repay, he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold.
5:55
This makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money. So increased income allows increased borrowing
6:03
which allows increased spending. And since one person's spending is another person's income,
6:09
this leads to more increased borrowing and so on. This self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth
6:17
and is why we have Cycles. In a transaction, you have to give something in order to get something
6:25
and how much you get depends on how much you produce over time we learned
6:31
and that accumulated knowledge raises are living standards we call this productivity growth
6:37
those who were invented and hard-working raise their productivity and their living standards faster
6:43
than those who are complacent and lazy,
6:48
but that isn't necessarily true over the short run. Productivity matters most in the long run, but credit matters most in the short run.
6:54
This is because productivity growth doesn't fluctuate much, so it's not a big driver of economic swings.
7:01
Debt is — because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it
7:06
and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we pay it back. Debt swings occur in two big cycles.
7:14
One takes about 5 to 8 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years.
7:20
While most people feel the swings, they typically don't see them as cycles because they see them too up close -- day by day, week by week.
7:29
In this chapter we are going to step back and look at these three big forces and how they interact to make up our experiences.
7:37
As mentioned, swings around the line are not due to how much innovation or hard work there is, they're primarily due to how much credit there is.
7:46
Let's for a second imagine an economy without credit. In this economy, the only way I can increase my spending
7:53
is to increase my income, which requires me to be more productive and do more work.
7:59
Increased productivity is the only way for growth. Since my spending is another person's income,
8:05
the economy grows every time I or anyone else is more productive.
8:10
If we follow the transactions and play this out, we see a progression like the productivity growth line.
8:16
But because we borrow, we have cycles. This isn't due to any laws or regulation,
8:23
it's due to human nature and the way that credit works. Think of borrowing as simply a way of pulling spending forward.
8:32
In order to buy something you can't afford, you need to spend more than you make.
8:37
To do this, you essentially need to borrow from your future self. In doing so you create a time in the future
8:44
that you need to spend less than you make in order to pay it back. It very quickly resembles a cycle.
8:51
Basically, anytime you borrow you create a cycle.? This is as true for an individual as it is for the economy.
8:59
This is why understanding credit is so important because it sets into motion a mechanical, predictable series of events that will happen in the future.
9:08
This makes credit different from money. Money is what you settle transactions with.
9:14
When you buy a beer from a bartender with cash, the transaction is settled immediately.
9:20
But when you buy a beer with credit, it's like starting a bar tab. You're saying you promise to pay in the future.
9:27
Together you and the bartender create an asset and a liability. You just created credit. Out of thin air.
9:35
It's not until you pay the bar tab later that the asset and liability disappear,
9:41
the debt goes away and the transaction is settled. The reality is that most of what people call money is actually credit.
9:50
The total amount of credit in the United States is about $50 trillion
9:55
and the total amount of money is only about $3 trillion. Remember, in an economy without credit:
10:02
the only way to increase your spending is to produce more. But in an economy with credit,
10:07
you can also increase your spending by borrowing. As a result, an economy with credit has more spending
10:14
and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run, but not over the long run.
10:20
Now, don't get me wrong, credit isn't necessarily something bad that just causes cycles.
10:25
It's bad when it finances over-consumption that can't be paid back.
10:30
However, it's good when it efficiently allocates resources and produces income so you can pay back the debt.
10:37
For example, if you borrow money to buy a big TV, it doesn't generate income for you to pay back the debt.
10:44
But, if you borrow money to buy a tractor — and that tractor let's you harvest more crops and earn more money
10:51
— then, you can pay back your debt and improve your living standards. In an economy with credit,
10:57
we can follow the transactions and see how credit creates growth. Let me give you an example:
11:04
Suppose you earn $100,000 a year and have no debt. You are creditworthy enough to borrow $10,000 dollars
11:11
- say on a credit card - so you can spend $110,000 dollars even though you only earn $100,000 dollars.
11:18
Since your spending is another person's income, someone is earning $110,000 dollars.
11:25
The person earning $110,000 dollars with no debt can borrow $11,000 dollars,
11:31
so he can spend $121,000 dollars even though he has only earned $110,000 dollars.
11:38
His spending is another person's income and by following the transactions
11:43
we can begin to see how this process works in a self-reinforcing pattern. But remember, borrowing creates cycles
11:51
and if the cycle goes up, it eventually needs to come down. This leads us into the Short Term Debt Cycle.
12:00
As economic activity increases, we see an expansion - the first phase of the short term debt cycle.
12:06
Spending continues to increase and prices start to rise. This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit
12:15
- which can be created instantly out of thin air. When the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods:
12:22
prices rise. When prices rise, we call this inflation.
12:28
The Central Bank doesn't want too much inflation because it causes problems.
12:35
Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates. With higher interest rates, fewer people can afford to borrow money.
12:42
And the cost of existing debts rises. Think about this as the monthly payments on your credit card going up.
12:50
Because people borrow less and have higher debt repayments, they have less money leftover to spend, so spending slows
12:58
...and since one person's spending is another person's income, incomes drop...and so on and so forth.
13:06
When people spend less, prices go down. We call this deflation.
13:12
Economic activity decreases and we have a recession. If the recession becomes too severe
13:20
and inflation is no longer a problem, the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again.
13:27
With low interest rates, debt repayments are reduced and borrowing and spending pick up
13:33
and we see another expansion. As you can see, the economy works like a machine.
13:40
In the short term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit.
13:47
When credit is easily available, there's an economic expansion.
13:52
When credit isn't easily available, there's a recession. And note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank.
14:00
The short term debt cycle typically lasts 5 - 8 years and happens over and over again for decades.
14:08
But notice that the bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt.
14:16
Why? Because people push it — they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt.
14:25
It's human nature. Because of this, over long periods of time,
14:30
debts rise faster than incomes creating the Long Term Debt Cycle.
14:38
Despite people becoming more indebted, lenders even more freely extend credit.
14:44
Why? Because everybody thinks things are going great! People are just focusing on what's been happening lately.
14:51
And what has been happening lately? Incomes have been rising!
14:57
Asset values are going up! The stock market roars! It's a boom! It pays to buy goods, services, and financial assets
15:06
with borrowed money! When people do a lot of that, we call it a bubble.
15:11
So even though debts have been growing, incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them.
15:18
Let's call the ratio of debt-to-income the debt burden. So long as incomes continue to rise,
15:25
the debt burden stays manageable. At the same time asset values soar.
15:30
People borrow huge amounts of money to buy assets as investments causing their prices to rise even higher.
15:37
People feel wealthy. So even with the accumulation of lots of debt,
15:43
rising incomes and asset values help borrowers remain creditworthy for a long time.
15:49
But this obviously can not continue forever. And it doesn't. Over decades, debt burdens slowly increase creating larger and larger debt repayments.
16:00
At some point, debt repayments start growing faster than incomes forcing people to cut back on their spending.
16:08
And since one person's spending is another person's income, incomes begin to go down...
16:14
...which makes people less creditworthy causing borrowing to go down. Debt repayments continue to rise
16:22
which makes spending drop even further... ...and the cycle reverses itself.
16:27
This is the long term debt peak. Debt burdens have simply become too big.
16:34
For the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world this happened in 2008.
16:40
It happened for the same reason it happened in Japan in 1989 and in the United States back in 1929.
16:48
Now the economy begins Deleveraging. In a deleveraging; people cut spending,
16:56
incomes fall, credit disappears, assets prices drop, banks get squeezed,
17:02
the stock market crashes, social tensions rise and the whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way.
17:09
As incomes fall and debt repayments rise, borrowers get squeezed. No longer creditworthy,
17:17
credit dries up and borrowers can no longer borrow enough money to make their debt repayments.
17:23
Scrambling to fill this hole, borrowers are forced to sell assets. The rush to sell assets floods the market
17:31
This is when the stock market collapses, the real estate market tanks and banks get into trouble.
17:39
As asset prices drop, the value of the collateral borrowers can put up drops.
17:44
This makes borrowers even less creditworthy. People feel poor.
17:51
Credit rapidly disappears. Less spending › less income › less wealth ›
17:57
less credit › less borrowing and so on. It's a vicious cycle.
18:03
This appears similar to a recession but the difference here is that interest rates can't be lowered to save the day.
18:10
In a recession, lowering interest rates works to stimulate the borrowing. However, in a deleveraging, lowering interest rates doesn't work because
18:18
interest rates are already low and soon hit 0% - so the stimulation ends.
18:25
Interest rates in the United States hit 0% during the deleveraging of the 1930s
18:30
and again in 2008. The difference between a recession and a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging borrowers' debt burdens have
18:40
simply gotten too big and can't be relieved by lowering interest rates. Lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back.
18:50
Borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value.
18:55
They feel crippled by the debt - they don't even want more! Lenders stop lending. Borrowers stop borrowing.
19:03
Think of the economy as being not-creditworthy, just like an individual.
19:09
So what do you do about a deleveraging? The problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down.
19:17
There are four ways this can happen. 1. people, businesses, and governments cut their spending.
19:24
2. debts are reduced through defaults and restructurings. 3. wealth is redistributed from the 'haves' to the 'have nots'.
19:34
and finally, 4. the central bank prints new money. These 4 ways have happened in every deleveraging in modern history.
19:45
Usually, spending is cut first. As we just saw, people, businesses, banks and even governments tighten their belts and
19:52
cut their spending so that they can pay down their debt. This is often referred to as austerity.
19:58
When borrowers stop taking on new debts, and start paying down old debts, you might expect the debt burden to decrease.
20:06
But the opposite happens! Because spending is cut - and one man's spending is another man's income - it causes
20:14
incomes to fall. They fall faster than debts are repaid and the debt burden actually gets worse. As we've seen,
20:23
this cut in spending is deflationary and painful. Businesses are forced to cut costs...
20:29
which means less jobs and higher unemployment. This leads to the next step: debts must be reduced!
20:37
Many borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans — and a borrower's debts are a lender's assets.
20:44
When borrowers don't repay the bank, people get nervous that the bank won't be able to repay them
20:50
so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank. Banks get squeezed and people,
20:55
businesses and banks default on their debts. This severe economic contraction is a depression.
21:03
A big part of a depression is people discovering much of what they thought
21:08
was their wealth isn't really there. Let's go back to the bar.
21:13
When you bought a beer and put it on a bar tab, you promised to repay the bartender. Your promise became an asset of the bartender.
21:23
But if you break your promise - if you don't pay him back and essentially default on your bar tab -
21:29
then the 'asset' he has isn't really worth anything. It has basically disappeared.
21:35
Many lenders don't want their assets to disappear and agree to debt restructuring. Debt restructuring means lenders get paid back
21:44
less or get paid back over a longer time frame or at a lower interest rate that was first agreed. Somehow
21:52
a contract is broken in a way that reduces debt. Lenders would rather have a little of something than all of nothing.
21:59
Even though debt disappears, debt restructuring causes income and asset values to disappear faster,
22:06
so the debt burden continues to gets worse. Like cutting spending, debt reduction
22:12
is also painful and deflationary. All of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment
22:21
means the government collects fewer taxes.
22:27
At the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen. Many of the unemployed have inadequate savings
22:33
and need financial support from the government. Additionally, governments create stimulus plans
22:39
and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy. Governments' budget deficits explode in a
22:47
deleveraging because they spend more than they earn in taxes. This is what is happening when you hear about the budget deficit on the news.
22:55
To fund their deficits, governments need to either raise taxes
23:01
or borrow money. But with incomes falling and so many unemployed, who is the money going to come from? The rich.
23:09
Since governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the people,
23:17
governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy which facilitates a redistribution of wealth in the economy -
23:24
from the 'haves' to the 'have nots'. The 'have-nots,' who are suffering, begin to resent the wealthy 'haves.'
23:30
The wealthy 'haves,' being squeezed by the weak economy, falling asset prices,
23:36
higher taxes, begin to resent the 'have nots.' If the depression continues social disorder can break out.
23:43
Not only do tensions rise within countries, they can rise between countries - especially debtor and creditor countries.
23:52
This situation can lead to political change that can sometimes be extreme.
23:58
In the 1930s, this led to Hitler coming to power, war in Europe, and depression in the United States. Pressure to do something
24:08
to end the depression increases. Remember, most of what people thought was money was actually credit.
24:14
So, when credit disappears, people don't have enough money. People are desperate for money and you remember who can print money?
24:23
The Central Bank can. Having already lowered its interest rates to nearly 0
24:30
- it's forced to print money. Unlike cutting spending, debt reduction, and wealth redistribution,
24:37
printing money is inflationary and stimulative. Inevitably, the central bank prints new money
24:43
— out of thin air — and uses it to buy financial assets and government bonds. It happened in the United States during the Great Depression
24:52
and again in 2008, when the United States' central bank — the Federal Reserve — printed over two trillion dollars.
24:59
Other central banks around the world that could, printed a lot of money, too. By buying financial assets with this money,
25:07
it helps drive up asset prices which makes people more creditworthy. However, this only helps those who own financial assets.
25:15
You see, the central bank can print money but it can only buy financial assets.
25:21
The Central Government, on the other hand, can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people
25:29
but it can't print money. So, in order to stimulate the economy, the two must cooperate.
25:35
By buying government bonds, the Central Bank essentially lends money to the government,
25:41
allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending on goods and services through its stimulus programs
25:48
and unemployment benefits. This increases people's income as well as the government's debt. However,
25:56
it will lower the economy's total debt burden. This is a very risky time. Policy makers need to balance the four ways that debt
26:05
burdens come down. The deflationary ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in
26:13
order to maintain stability. If balanced correctly, there can be a
26:18
Beautiful Deleveraging. You see, a deleveraging can be ugly or it can be beautiful.
26:25
How can a deleveraging be beautiful? Even though a deleveraging is a difficult situation,
26:33
handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful. A lot more beautiful than the debt-fueled, unbalanced excesses of the
26:42
leveraging phase. In a beautiful deleveraging, debts decline relative to income, real economic growth is positive,
26:51
and inflation isn't a problem. It is achieved by having the right balance.
26:56
The right balance requires a certain mix of cutting spending, reducing debt, transferring wealth
27:04
and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained. People ask if printing money will raise inflation.
27:13
It won't if it offsets falling credit. Remember, spending is what matters.
27:18
A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on price as a dollar
27:24
of spending paid for with credit. By printing money, the Central Bank can make up for the disappearance of credit
27:31
with an increase in the amount of money. In order to turn things around, the Central Bank needs to not only pump up
27:38
income growth but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the
27:43
accumulated debt. So, what do I mean by that? Basically, income needs to grow faster than debt grows. For example:
27:52
let's assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to- income ratio of 100%.
27:58
That means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the
28:03
entire country makes in a year. Now think about the interest rate on that debt,
28:09
let's say it is 2%. If debt is growing at 2% because of that interest rate and
28:15
income is only growing at around only 1%, you will never reduce the debt burden.
28:20
You need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above the rate of interest.
28:25
However, printing money can easily be abused because it's so easy to do and people prefer it to the alternatives.
28:33
The key is to avoid printing too much money and causing unacceptably high inflation, the way Germany did during its
28:41
deleveraging in the 1920's. If policymakers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn't so dramatic.
28:48
Growth is slow but debt burdens go down. That's a beautiful deleveraging.
28:54
When incomes begin to rise, borrowers begin to appear more creditworthy.
28:59
And when borrowers appear more creditworthy, lenders begin to lend money again. Debt burdens finally begin to fall.
29:08
Able to borrow money, people can spend more. Eventually, the economy begins to grow again,
29:14
leading to the reflation phase of the long term debt cycle. Though the deleveraging process can be horrible if handled badly,
29:22
if handled well, it will eventually fix the problem. It takes roughly a decade or more
29:29
for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal - hence the term 'lost decade.'
29:37
Of course, the economy is a little more complicated than this template suggests.
29:43
However, laying the short term debt cycle on top of the long term debt cycle
29:48
and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we've been,
29:55
where we are now and where we are probably headed. So in summary, there are three rules of thumb that I'd like you to take away
30:03
from this: First: Don't have debt rise faster than income,
30:08
because your debt burdens will eventually crush you. Second: Don't have income rise faster than productivity,
30:16
because you will eventually become uncompetitive. And third: Do all that you can to raise your productivity,
30:24
because, in the long run, that's what matters most.
30:29
This is simple advice for you and it's simple advice for policy makers. You might be surprised but most people — including most policy makers — don't pay enough attention
30:38
to this. This template has worked for me and I hope that it'll work for you.
30:44
Thank you.
