how countries go broke chapter 2 the following is an excerpt from an
0:06
early draft from Ray Dario's new book how countries go broke which is available for pre-order on the link in
0:12
the description this summary is brought to you by Mr Mentor preneur please like
0:18
And subscribe how countries go broke chapter 2 chapter 2 the mechanics in
0:24
words and Concepts note this chapter gives unconventional Concepts about the
0:29
mechanics of how markets work that I believe would be valuable for professionals and aspiring professionals
0:35
but are probably beyond the interests of others I suggest that you give it a try to see whether or not it's the sort of
0:42
thing you'd like to get into because everything that happens has reasons that make it happen it appears to me that
0:49
everything changes like a perpetual motion machine to understand this machine one needs to understand its
0:56
mechanics and because everything affects everything else these mechanics are very
1:01
complex as a result of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence I believe that
1:06
we are on the brink of almost understanding it all but for now we have to labor along the old-fashioned way
1:14
with people studying what happened using contemporary computers to Aid them
1:20
that's how I created this description of the mechanics of the de credit money
1:26
economic Dynamic which is of course only one big part of the greater dynamic in
1:32
my feeble attempts to understand and describe the most important mechanics that change the world as we know it I do
1:40
these in-depth studies and then try to create more simplified explanations of
1:45
them keep in mind that this is a very simplified picture zooming out to the
1:51
highest level the five most important drivers of change that are important to understand are the debt chash credit ch
2:00
money economic cycle the internal political order disorder cycle the
2:06
external geopolitical order disorder cycle acts of nature droughts floods and
2:14
pandemics human inventiveness most importantly of new
2:19
technologies these are the biggest forces that affect each other to shape the biggest things that happen if you
2:25
want to understand what I learned from experiencing and studying the in a more complete way than I can cover in this
2:33
study you can read about them in my book principles for dealing with the changing World Order in this study we are going
2:40
to examine the first of those the credit debt cha money economic Dynamic focusing
2:48
most intensely on The Late part of the longer term debt cycle when Central governments and central banks go broke I
2:55
will start by a walking you through some mechanics of how Market prices are determined and then B looking at how the
3:03
long-term debt cycle works with that as a background I will then turn to C the
3:09
archetypical sequence that leads to a country hitting the limits of debt and money and central banks and Central
3:16
governments going broke at the same time we will be exploring the other four
3:21
forces because the interactions of these five forces cannot be overlooked in
3:27
observing the resulting overall big cycle from what I can see we are likely
3:32
entering the very turbulent stage in the overall big cycle driven by the interactions of these five big forces
3:39
and the resulting changes in the world order will be big I hope this study can
3:44
contribute to a better understanding of the Dynamics and better decisionmaking to produce the best outcome
3:51
possible how the Machine Works to me money and credit are the lifeblood of
3:57
the economy they circulate nutrients I.E spending power from the parts of the
4:03
system that have excess amounts of it to the parts of the system that can best use it the central government is like
4:10
the brain that directs how the system works while also taking in and using some of the money and credit typically
4:17
about 153% of it to perform its functions EG providing for social
4:23
programs defense Etc the central bank is like the heart that produces and pumps
4:29
money and credit through the system if the exchanges go well and those who get
4:35
Capital use it productively then the providers of capital the users of it and
4:40
the economic system as a whole all Prosper if they don't the system will
4:46
become ill and experience trauma to be clear viewing the debt dynamic as a
4:51
cyclical perpetual motion machine working in essentially the same way through time and across countries does
4:59
doesn't mean that there are not changes over time and differences between countries it's just that these changes
5:06
are comparatively unimportant in relation to the Timeless and Universal mechanics and principles that are far
5:14
less well understood than they should be to me it's invaluable to first see these
5:20
Timeless and Universal principles of how the machine works and then focus on the
5:25
differences and what they are due to because this approach provides provides a richer understanding of the cause
5:32
effect relationships for that reason I will start with these most important
5:37
Timeless and Universal mechanics and principles to convey them in brief I
5:42
will explain just the major ones in a big picture simplified way rather than a
5:47
detailed and precise way in this big picture simplified model the following
5:53
describes the major parts and major players and how they operate together to
5:59
make the machine work the five major parts and how they work there are five
6:04
major parts of the economic system that make up my simplified model of the machine they are Goods services and
6:13
investment assets money used to buy these things credit issued to buy these
6:19
things debt liabilities that are created when purchases are made with credit and
6:25
debt assets I.E deposits and bonds which
6:30
since one person's liabilities are another's assets are the other side of the debt
6:36
liabilities if you can understand the transactions that occur as being made up of these five major parts you can pretty
6:44
much understand why there are big debt and economic Cycles to start I will walk
6:50
through how I think about transactions and some other important Baseline
6:55
mechanics as mentioned Goods services and investment assets can be bought with
7:01
either money or credit money unlike credit settles transactions for example
7:08
if you buy a car with money after the transaction you're both done what has
7:13
constituted money has changed throughout history and across currencies for long
7:19
periods of History money was a promise to deliver a certain amount of gold or other hard asset in Fiat monetary
7:27
systems which we've been in since the us left the gold standard in
7:32
1971 money is what central banks print and is more like a form of credit in
7:38
that it is a promise to deliver buying power not an actual hard asset but money
7:43
is different from credit as at this time it can only be created by central banks
7:49
and can be created in whatever amounts the central banks choose to create
7:54
credit unlike money leaves a lingering obligation to pay and it can be created
8:00
by mutual agreement of any willing parties credit produces buying power
8:06
that didn't exist before without necessarily creating money it allows
8:11
borrowers to spend more than they earn which pushes up the demand and prices for what is being bought over the near
8:18
term while creating debt that over the longer term requires the borrowers who
8:24
are now debtors to spend less than they earn as they pay back their debts
8:30
this reduces demand and prices in the future which contributes to the cyclicality of the system because debt
8:37
is the promise to deliver money and central banks determine the amount of money in existence central banks have a
8:44
lot of power though not exactly proportional the more money that is in existence the more credit and spending
8:52
there can be the less money in existence the less credit and spending there can
8:58
be now let's let's look at how prices are set to explain my Approach for
9:04
understanding how prices are set which is different from the conventional economists approach I need to start at
9:10
the most basic building block for understanding all markets and economics which is the
9:16
transaction all markets and all economics are simply the Aggregates of the transactions that make them up and a
9:23
transaction is simply the buyer giving money or credit to a seller and the
9:28
seller giving a good a service or a financial asset to the buyer in exchange
9:35
the price in a transaction equals the amount of money punch credit the buyer gives divided by the quantity of
9:42
whatever the seller gives in that transaction and a market is the aggregate of those
9:48
transactions for example a transaction to buy wheat occurs when a buyer gives a
9:53
certain amount of total money to a seller in exchange for a certain quantity of wheat and a market consists
10:00
of all the buyers and sellers making exchanges for the same things EG the
10:06
wheat Market consists of different people making different transactions for different reasons over time and these
10:13
many exchanges are what determine the price so Price p Wars the amount spent
10:20
on something Chi the total quantity of it that is sold Q or more simply p Ching
10:29
wam Q in other words since the price of any good service or financial asset
10:35
equals the total amount spent by buyers spy divided by the total quantity sold
10:41
by sellers Q if you know total spending total dollars and you know the total
10:47
quantity sold total Q you will know the price and everything else you need to know that is indisputably how it is so
10:55
it is indisputable that the best way to estimate the price is to estimate the total spending and divide it by the
11:02
total quantity sold and what is the best way to estimate these things it is to
11:08
understand the motivations of the buyers and sellers all buyers have their own
11:13
reasons for spending the amounts of money that they are spending to get the quantity they are buying and all sellers
11:20
have their own reasons for selling the quantity they are selling to get the money they're getting what I'm saying is
11:27
conveyed in the conceptual diagram below while this might look and sound complicated it's really not for each
11:35
product the buyers and sellers have their reasons for making those purchases and sales and it's pretty easy to
11:42
determine who the main buyers and sellers are and what motivates them if
11:47
you can figure out major buyers reasons for spending and you know the major sellers reasons for selling you can
11:54
pretty accurately predict their actions and thus the price this way way of
11:59
looking at Price determination is very different from how most economists look at it the traditional way measures both
12:07
demand and Supply in terms of quantity I.E quantity bought and quantity sold
12:14
where my Approach looks at amounts spent to buy instead of quantity bought this
12:19
leads to different ways of explaining why prices change the conventional approach describes price changes as
12:26
occurring because the quantity demanded and or the quantity supplied changes how
12:32
these changes occur is called price elasticity this way of looking at the market implies that there is one
12:38
elasticity of demand and one elasticity of supply and different theories emerge
12:44
about how the market digests information I don't think that approach makes sense
12:50
because it assumes that a change in Supply will always have the same effect on price I.E elasticity which isn't true
12:59
for example if more money is spent on a product because buyers have more money to spend the price of that product will
13:06
be higher ultimately if your goal is to understand and predict price movements
13:13
you are much better off trying to connect who is doing what in the market with how prices are changing I started
13:20
doing this as a Commodities Trader back in the 1970s and found that not only did this
13:26
approach work better for me than more conventional approaches it could also apply to all kinds of products and
13:34
assets including Financial ones in fact I use this template to model not just
13:40
how specific markets work but entire economies but that's a subject for
13:45
another time if you play with the previously shown formula model a bit you
13:52
will see that prices change when there are changes in the rates of spending and or quantities sold for example if the
13:59
rate of buying goes from X to x - 10% and all else stays the same the price
14:07
will fall by 10% so if you identify rates of unsustainable buying and or
14:13
rates of unsustainable selling you can identify price and economic reversals
14:19
ahead of them occurring and if you calculate what a return to a more normal level of buying or selling is you can
14:27
calculate the approximate price change that is needed and likely there are a
14:32
number of other implications for how this different approach leads to Unique perspectives on how economies and
14:39
markets work but the most important one for understanding short-term market and economic Cycles is that it shows how
14:47
these Cycles are driven more by creations of money and credit that lead to changes in spending s than by the
14:54
changes in the quantity sold Q because most Goods services and investment
15:01
assets are produced to satisfy demand IE in response to S I also see that when a
15:09
more money and credit are created so there is more spending and B producers
15:16
have the capacity to produce more quantity then C there can be more
15:21
non-inflationary growth because both spending SPO and the quantity Q sold
15:27
increase where as when a more money and credit are created so there is more
15:33
spending but B There is little or no capacity so producers can't produce much
15:39
more then C there is little real growth and a lot more inflation these
15:45
principles explain why the early cycle when there is plenty of excess capacity and central banks are stimulative is
15:52
characterized by strong growth and little inflation and the late cycle typically has weak growth
15:59
and big price Rises that is what cyclical inflation and growth look like
16:05
later in this study we will go through this in more detail and explore what monetary inflations and inflationary
16:12
depressions look like how does productivity fit into the above if
16:18
productivity growth is high producers can produce more quantity Q as more
16:24
money and credit are produced so it allows non-inflationary growth to continue for longer of course
16:31
productivity can be hard to measure directly as productivity can also show up as products improving in quality or
16:39
the marginal cost of producing something falling all the way to zero as has
16:45
happened for producing photos and electronic books now let's look more closely at the reasons buyers spend and
16:52
sellers sell the quantities they sell instead of doing that for all the individual items I will look at the big
16:59
categories to convey the principles that affect them all people buy goods and
17:05
services to use and they buy Investments to make money I.E as stor holds of
17:11
wealth how much they spend on goods and services versus Investments depends on
17:16
what the goods and services they want to use cost relative to the amount of money and credit they have to spend and the
17:24
relative appeal of spending on goods and services to that of spending on Financial assets and of course they have
17:31
their own reasons for choosing which goods and services and which financial assets they buy what people choose to
17:39
spend their money and credit on is based on the relative appeal of the items
17:44
people are constantly making comparisons in two Dimensions one one item for
17:50
another EG money for corn gold currency just about everything else and two the
17:58
same item for delivery at different points in time EG corn gold currency for
18:04
delivery today versus for delivery a year in the future based on their preferences as a result there is an
18:12
enormous array of relative Appeal assessments to be made arbitrages and
18:17
relatively sure bets are the most powerful types of bets in determining relative
18:23
pricing currencies are mediums of exchange and Stor holds of wealth in
18:28
debt Assets in other words they facilitate both transactions and
18:34
investing Investments are exchanges of money and credit today for money and
18:39
Credit in the future all investment markets derive their value by providing
18:44
money in two ways through their yields and through their price changes together
18:50
they make the total return so for all Investments Total return yield plus
18:57
price change by by and large all investment markets compete with each other on the basis of the total returns
19:04
they provide that is because a most investors care more about the total
19:09
returns they get than they care about whether it comes in the form of yield or Price appreciation and B there is an
19:17
ability to Arbitrage Investments based on their total returns to show how that
19:23
works let's look at how investing in bonds would be compared with investing in gold to determine the price
19:29
relationship because gold has no yield and a US treasury bond has a yield of x%
19:36
EEG 5% it would be illogical for anyone to buy gold unless the price is expected
19:43
to go up by more than x% per year EG 5% per year said differently the market is
19:50
priced for the gold price to rise by 5% relative to the price of treasuries
19:56
investors form their views about what Will deter determine the gold price change EG one big factor is the amount
20:03
of inflation based on the amount of money and credit that is produced and they look at the relative attractiveness
20:10
of the 5% yield that the bonds are offering and the extent the gold price
20:15
would appreciate due to the depreciation in the value of money if they think that
20:20
gold Will Rise by less than 5% they can buy bonds and sell gold and if they
20:26
think gold will go up more than 5 5% they can do the reverse in either case
20:32
they'll make money if they're right on top of this simple price analysis there
20:37
is a lot of financial engineering EG leveraging and hedging that turns one
20:42
thing into the equivalent of another to make relative value bets and arbitrages
20:47
that create a whole Matrix of market prices an enormous amount of money is
20:53
allocated in this way and it would be easy to make a lot of money if the choices between options were easy but
21:00
because we know it's not easy to make money in the markets we can assume that the markets do a pretty good job of
21:07
making these estimates and pricing assets correctly at the same time
21:13
because I and others who have been successful at investing couldn't have been successful at investing if the
21:19
markets were perfect we can assume that it's not perfectly done and there are opportunities to make money in the
21:25
markets if you have a better understanding than others anyway my main
21:30
point is that this is how to determine how markets are priced which you will soon see as helpful in understanding the
21:37
debt credit money economic Dynamic the expected rates of return on investment
21:44
assets relative to the rate of inflation I.E the expected real returns of
21:49
investments will influence how much money goes into each of these by and
21:54
large and Investments inflation adjusted real s return returns are more important
22:00
than its non-inflation or I.E nominal returns because a Investments are made
22:07
to be stor holds of wealth so buying power matters most and B there are
22:13
arbitrages and relative value bets between real assets and financial assets
22:18
that drive their relative prices in other words the expected returns of
22:23
putting money into financial investments are compared with the expected returns of putting money into real stuff EG real
22:32
estate precious metals Commodities art Etc so the returns of all Investments
22:39
especially the returns of government bonds because their returns are so well known since the yield is set and there
22:47
is virtually no risk of default for Bonds denominated in a country's own currency are compared with the inflation
22:54
rate so when bond yields are low relative to inflation bonds will be sold
23:00
and inflation assets will be bought and vice versa also because the decline in
23:06
the value of money and credit that arises from central banks creating lots of both causes the prices of goods
23:13
services and most Financial assets to rise when central banks create a lot of
23:19
money and credit that tends to lead investors to favor inflation hedge assets prices are linked by certain
23:27
determinants that one must understand to understand relative pricing when most
23:32
nonprofessional investors think about the price they usually think about the price for delivery of the item today
23:39
which is called the spot price most markets also have prices for deliveries
23:44
sometime in the future which are called forward or Futures prices and there are
23:50
arbitrages or relative value bets that one can take that determine the price
23:55
relationship of the same items at different delivery dates the same sort of analysis of the relative appeal of
24:02
the same Financial assets EG short-term government debt and long-term government
24:08
debt takes place eg a big factor determining that is the projected Pace
24:15
at which the central bank will increase or decrease interest rates debt is
24:20
currency and currency is debt since a debt asset is the promise to receive a
24:25
specified amount of currency at a future date debt and currency are essentially
24:30
the same things if you don't like the currency you must not like the debt asset EG bonds and if you don't like the
24:38
bonds you must not like the currency if you take into consideration their relative yields in other words if you
24:46
don't like one you must not like the other remember the Gold Bond price
24:51
comparison process described earlier of looking at the relative yields plus the
24:57
expected price changes the relative total returns this sets the spot and
25:04
Futures prices for bonds and gold and it works the same for assessing the value
25:09
of different currencies and different debt assets of different countries that
25:14
assessment drives Capital Flows In important ways that are very relevant to the debt issue at hand more specifically
25:23
let's say the government interest rate which is widely considered default risk-free because government central
25:29
banks can print money to make payments in one country EG Japan is below that in
25:36
another country by x% per year if that's the case then the expected appreciation
25:43
in that currency must be at the same percentage rate otherwise it would be
25:48
easy to make virtually risk-free profits by owning the bonds with a higher interest rate instead the difference in
25:56
the interest rates is expected to be eaten up by the higher interest rate currency falling compared to the lower
26:03
interest rate currency but what if that Currency Change Is Not expected to offset the interest rate difference for
26:10
example if the 10-year interest rate in country a is lower EG 3% lower than that
26:17
in country B's currency denominated Bond you'd ordinarily expect country A's
26:23
currency to rise to eat up the difference from the higher interest rate
26:28
What If instead country A's currency is expected to fall EG by 2% per year in
26:36
that case there is virtually risk-free profit to be made investors will flock
26:41
into the trade selling the lower yielding currency Char debt that will
26:46
produce one of two adjustments or a combination a the spot currency will
26:52
have to fall by 40% in this example or B the 10-year interest rate will have to
26:59
rise by 5% which will send the bond prices down by about
27:05
40% or if those adjustments can't happen say there are capital controls or the
27:11
like if the interest stays 3% less and the currency Falls by 2% then the loss
27:18
relative to holding country B's bonds will be 5% per year which over the 10
27:23
years will compound to 40% any way you cut it the bond return
27:29
in country A's currency will be very bad if the nominal Bond returns are not bad
27:35
I.E the bonds do not depreciate and debt burdens are not reduced in nominal terms
27:41
because neither a the price of the bonds falls in the local currency because the
27:47
interest rates rise to provide an appropriate return in light of the declining value of the currency nor B
27:54
the currency declines to a level that makes it cheap enough to provide adequate price appreciation to make up
28:01
for the interest rates being too low then the bad Return of the bond will come about because C the annual interest
28:09
rate and weakness in the currency will not compensate for the inflation now
28:14
that we understand how the mechanics of these major parts work and how transactions are driven by the
28:20
motivations of players in dealing with those parts you will understand how the machine works and what is likely to
28:27
happen next so let's get into that the major types of players and how they
28:32
behave to drive what happens five major types of players Drive money and debt Cycles they are
28:40
those that borrow and become debtors that I call borrower debtors which can
28:46
be private or government entities those that lend and become creditors that I
28:51
call lender creditors which can be private or government entities those
28:56
that intermediate the money and credit transactions between the lender creditors and the borrower debtors which
29:03
are commonly called Banks Central governments and government-controlled
29:09
central banks which can create money and Credit in the country's currency and
29:14
influence the cost of money and credit credit debt expansions can only take
29:20
place when both borrower debtors and lender creditors are willing to borrow and lend so the deal must be good for
29:28
both said differently because one person's debts are another's assets for
29:34
the system to work it takes both borrower debtors and lender creditors to
29:39
want to enter into these transactions however what is good for one is quite often bad for the other for
29:47
example for borrower debtors to do well interest rates can't be too high while
29:52
for lender creditors to do well interest rates can't be too low if interest rates
29:58
rates are too high for borrower debtors they will have to slash spending or sell assets to service their debts or they
30:05
might not be able to pay them back which will lead markets and the economy to fall at the same time if interest rates
30:12
are too low to compensate lender creditors they won't lend and will sell their debt assets causing interest rates
30:20
to rise or central banks to print a lot of money and buy debt in an attempt to
30:25
hold interest rates down this printing of money buying of debt will create
30:31
inflation causing a contraction in wealth and economic activity over time
30:37
environments shift between those that are good and bad for lender creditors and borrower debtors to be effective it
30:44
is critical that anyone who is involved in any way in markets and economies knows how to tell the difference this
30:52
Balancing Act and the swings between the two environments take place naturally
30:57
and times conditions make it impossible to achieve a good balance that causes
31:02
big debt market and economic risks before I describe the conditions that
31:08
produce these risks I want to First explain the other players motivations
31:13
and how they try to act on them private sector banks are the intermediaries
31:18
between lender creditors and borrower debtors so their motivations and how they work are important too in all
31:26
countries for thousands of years years banks have done essentially the same thing which is to try to make profits by
31:33
borrowing money from some and lending it to others earning money on the spread
31:39
how they do this creates the money credit debt Cycles most importantly the
31:44
unsustainable Bubbles and big debt crises how are these Bubbles and crises
31:50
created by the Banks lending out a lot more money than they have which they do
31:56
by repeatedly borrowing at a cost that is lower than the return they take in from lending that works well for the
32:03
society and is profitable for the banks when those who are lent money use it
32:08
productively enough to pay back their loans and when those the banks borrowed from don't want their money back in
32:16
amounts that are greater than what the banks actually have but debt crises happen when the loans aren't adequately
32:22
paid back or when the bank's creditors want to get more of the money they lent to the banks than the banks are able to
32:29
give them over the long run debts can't rise faster than the incomes that are needed to service them and interest
32:36
rates can't be too high for borrower debtors or too low for lender creditors
32:41
for very long if debts keep Rising faster than incomes and or interest
32:47
rates are too high for borrower debtors or too low for lender creditors for too
32:53
long the imbalance will cause a big market and economic crisis for that
32:58
reason it pays to watch these ratios big debt crises come about when
33:04
the amounts of debt assets and debt liabilities become too large relative to
33:09
the amount of money in existence and or the amounts of goods and services in
33:14
existence central banks either directly or indirectly create money and credit
33:20
which is buying power buying power determines the total amount of spending on Goods services and investment assets
33:28
whatever amount of money and credit is created must be put into Goods services
33:34
and or financial assets I.E Investments so the total amount of money and credit
33:41
created determines the total amount of spending on Goods services and financial
33:47
assets as a result Goods services and financial assets tend to rise and
33:54
decline together with the es and flows of money and credit like all boats tend
33:59
to rise and fall with the es and flows of the sea what this money and credit go
34:05
into and the quantities of goods services and financial assets that are
34:10
produced are mostly determined by the choices made by thousands or millions of
34:15
Market participants central banks came into existence to smooth these Cycles most
34:21
importantly by handling big debt crises until relatively recently EG 1913 in the
34:29
United States there weren't central banks in most countries and money that was in private Banks was typically
34:36
either physical gold or silver or paper certificates to get gold and silver
34:43
throughout these times there were boom bust Cycles because borrower debtors lender creditors and Banks went through
34:50
the credit debt Cycles I just described these Cycles turned into big debt and
34:56
economic busts when too many debt assets and liabilities led to lender creditor
35:01
runs to get money from borrower debtors most importantly the banks these runs
35:07
produced debt market economic collapses that eventually LED governments to create central banks to lend money to
35:14
Banks and others when these big debt crises happened central banks can also
35:19
smooth the Cycles by varying interest rates and the amount of money and Credit in the system to change the behaviors of
35:27
borrower Deb ERS and lender creditors where do central banks get their money
35:32
from they print it literally and digitally which when done in large
35:37
amounts alleviates the debt problems because it provides money and credit to
35:42
those who desperately need it and wouldn't have had it otherwise but doing so also reduces the buying power of
35:49
money and debt assets and raises inflation from what it would have been
35:55
central banks want to keep debt and economic growth and inflation at acceptable levels in other words they
36:03
don't want debt and demand to grow much faster or slower than is sustainable and
36:08
they don't want inflation to be so high or so low that it is harmful to
36:13
influence these things they raise interest rates and tighten the availability of money or they lower
36:20
interest rates and ease the availability of money which influences lender creditors and borrower debtors who are
36:27
are striving to be profitable Central governments are political organizations with those who
36:33
run them serving at the pleasure of the people so they want to give the people what they want this is typically done
36:40
without paying for it which typically leads to central government borrowing which reinforces the cycle of creating
36:47
greater amounts of credit stimulation early and debt depressants later when
36:53
Central governments do their jobs well they tax and spend in ways that make broad-based productivity and
37:00
prosperity sometimes borrowing more than they are earning and sometimes paying it back and when central banks do their
37:08
jobs well they keep the credit debt and capital markets in relative balance
37:14
which produces less disruptive big swings however for the previously
37:19
mentioned reasons the bias to create more UPS in the economies and markets
37:24
through credit stimulation leads to long-term uptrend Trends in debt and Debt Service relative to incomes until
37:32
they become too large a percentage of income to be sustainable the greater the size of the debt assets and debt
37:39
liabilities relative to the real incomes being produced the more difficult The Balancing Act is so the greater the
37:46
likelihood of a debt cause downturn in the markets and economy because borrower
37:52
debtors lender creditors Banks Central governments and Central Bank banks are
37:58
the biggest players and drivers of these cycles and because they each have obvious incentives affecting their
38:05
behaviors it is pretty easy to anticipate what they are likely to do and what is likely to happen next when
38:12
debt growth is slow economies are weak and inflation is low Central Bankers
38:18
will lower interest rates and create more money and credit which will incentivize more borrowing and spending
38:24
on Goods services and investment assets which will drive the markets for these
38:30
things and the economy up at such times it is good to be a borrower debtor and
38:36
bad to be a lender creditor when debt growth and economic growth are unsustainably fast and inflation is
38:43
unacceptably high Central Bankers will raise interest rates and limit money and
38:48
credit which will incentivize more saving and less spending on Goods services and investment assets this will
38:56
drive the market and economy down because it's then better to be a lender creditor saver than a borrower debt or
39:03
spender this Dynamic leads to two interrelated Cycles a short-term one
39:09
that has averaged about 6 years in length give or take three years and a long-term one that has averaged about 80
39:16
years give or take 25 years which evolve around an upward trend line in
39:22
productivity that is due to Humanity's inventiveness I'll now brief review how
39:28
these Cycles transpire the short and long-term big debt Cycles by short-term
39:35
debt cycle I mean the cycle of one recessions that lead to two central
39:41
banks providing a lot of credit cheaply which creates a lot of debt that initially leads to three market and
39:48
economic Booms that lead to four Bubbles and inflations which lead to five
39:54
central Bankers tightening credit which leads to six market and economic weakening this cycle
40:00
typically lasts about 6 years give or take about three as of this writing
40:06
there have been 12.5 of these in the US since 1945 I.E at the time of my writing this
40:14
we are about halfway through the 13th each short-term debt cycle typically
40:19
ends with higher levels of debt than the previous cycle because policy makers try
40:24
to end recessions by lowering interest interest rates enough to get borrowing going again by long-term big debt cycle
40:34
I mean the cycle of building up debt assets and debt liabilities over long periods of time IE successive short-term
40:42
debt Cycles to amounts that eventually become unmanageable this leads to a combination
40:48
of big debt restructurings and big debt monetizations that produce a period of
40:54
big market and economic turbulence the short-term debt Cycles add up to the
40:59
long-term big debt Cycles which I will henceforth call the big debt cycle these
41:06
Cycles move markets and economies around an upward sloping trend line of rising living standards that is due to people's
41:14
inventiveness and the increases in productivity that come from it the incline of its upward slope in
41:20
productivity is primarily driven by the inventiveness of practical people EG
41:26
Entre R preneurs who are given adequate resources EG capital and work well with
41:33
others their co-workers government officials lawyers Etc to make
41:39
productivity improvements over a short period of time I.E want 10 years the short-term debt
41:47
cycle is dominant over a long period of time I.E 10 years and Beyond the
41:53
long-term debt cycle and the upward sloping trend line in productiv AC ity have much bigger effects conceptually
42:01
the way this Dynamic transpires looks like this to me what separates a sustainable debt cycle from an
42:07
unsustainable one is whether the debt creates enough income or more to pay for the debt service if incomes fail to grow
42:14
as quickly as debt and Debt Service the ratio of debts to incomes will mechanically grow which will require
42:20
increased borrowing to serve debt as well as to spend the cycle goes from low to high to unsustainably high debt and
42:27
Debt Service relative to incomes a sure sign of moving toward a debt crisis is
42:33
when there is a large and Rising amount of borrowing that is being used to pay for The Debt Service why don't Central
42:39
Bankers do a better job than they have been doing in smoothing out these debt Cycles by better containing debt so it
42:45
doesn't reach dangerous levels there are four reasons most everyone including Central
42:51
Bankers wants the markets and economy to go up because that's rewarding and they don't worry much about the pain of
42:57
paying back debts so they push the limits including becoming leverag to Long assets until that can't continue
43:05
because they have reached the point that debts are so burdensome they have to be restructured to be reduced relative to
43:11
incomes it is not clear exactly what risky debt levels are because it's not clear what will happen that will
43:17
determine future incomes there are opportunity costs and risks to not providing credit that creates debt debt
43:25
crises even big ones can usually be managed to reduce the pain they cause to acceptable levels debt isn't always bad
43:32
even when it's not economic two little credit CH debt growth can create economic problems as bad or worse than
43:39
too much with the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities that is because one credit
43:46
can be used to create great improvements that aren't profitable that would have been foregone without it and two the
43:52
losses from the debt problems can be spread out to be not intolerably painful if the government is in control of the
43:58
debt restructuring process and the debt is in the currency that the central bank can print however to avoid a debt crisis
44:06
debt must raise incomes to service the debts over time from one cycle to the
44:11
next debt liabilities and debt assets have virtually always increased to make the long-term debt cycle expansion in
44:19
virtually all cases that has continued until the debt burdens have become unsustainably large or the debt assets
44:25
have become intolerably low returns when there are a lot of debt assets and debt liabilities relative to incomes it
44:32
is difficult for Central Bankers to keep interest rates high enough to satisfy lender creditors without having them so
44:39
high that they unacceptably hurt borrower debtors and it is difficult for central banks to run monetary policy to
44:45
balance growth and inflation well and because holders of debt assets want to sell the debt one way or another debt is
44:53
going to have a bad return that puts Central Bankers in the position of having to choose between not printing
44:59
money and buying debt I.E not monetizing debt and letting interest rates rise
45:05
enough to cut credit demand and economic activity enough to reach the indifference equilibrium level that will
45:11
balance the buying and selling of the bonds this will make cash very valuable devalue most other assets like stocks
45:18
and hard assets cause deflation lead to debt defaults and restructurings and
45:23
depress economic activity this typically happens first and is intolerable which
45:28
leads to central banks to start printing money and buying debt I.E monetizing
45:34
debt to make up for the shortfall in demand which will make money readily available and reduce its value thus
45:40
raising inflation raise the value of most other assets like stocks and hard assets minimize debt defaults and
45:48
stimulate economic activity this typically eventually happens at that
45:53
part of the big debt cycle there need to be big reductions in debt liabilities and debt assets these are the big debt
46:00
crisis periods these big debt restructurings and debt monetizations end the prior big debt cycle by reducing
46:07
debt burdens and eliminating the prior monetary order leading to the next new big debt cycle and monetary order they
46:15
take place much like big changes in domestic political orders and big changes in World orders like seismic
46:21
shifts due to the old orders breaking down there are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to reduce the
46:28
debt burdens austerity I.E spending less debt defaults us restructurings the
46:35
Central Bank printing money and making purchases or providing guarantees and transfers of money and
46:42
credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less policy makers typically try austerity first
46:48
because that's the obvious thing to do and it's natural to want to let those who got themselves and others into
46:54
trouble bear the costs this is a big mistake austerity doesn't bring debt and
46:59
income back into balance because one person's debts are another person's assets cutting debts Cuts investors
47:06
assets and makes them poorer and because one person's spending is another person's income cutting spending cuts
47:12
incomes for that reason Cuts in debts and spending cause a commensurate cut in
47:18
net worths and incomes which is very painful also as the economy contracts
47:23
government revenues typically fall at the same time as demand on the government increase which leads deficits
47:29
to increase seeking to be fiscally responsible at this point governments tend to raise taxes which is also a
47:36
mistake because it further squeezes people and companies more simply said when there is spending that's greater
47:42
than revenues and liquid liabilities that are greater than liquid assets that produces the need to borrow and sell
47:49
debt assets which if there's not enough demand will produce one kind of Crisis EG deflationary or another EEG
47:58
inflationary as touched on earlier the best way for policy makers to reduce debt burdens without causing a big
48:05
economic crisis is to engineer what I call a beautiful deleveraging which is when policy makers both one restructure
48:12
the debts so Debt Service payments are spread out over more time or disposed of which is deflationary and depressing and
48:19
two have central banks print money and buy debt which is inflationary and
48:24
stimulating doing these two things in balanced amounts spreads out and reduces debt burdens and produces nominal
48:31
economic growth inflation plus real growth that is greater than nominal interest rates so debt burdens fall
48:38
relative to incomes if done well there is a balance between the deflationary and depressing reduction of debt
48:44
payments and the inflationary and stimulating printing of money and buying of debt by the central banks in the
48:51
countries I studied most big debt crises that occurred with the debts denominated in a country's own currency were
48:57
restructured quickly typically in 1 to 3 years these restructuring periods are
49:03
periods of great risk and opportunity if you want to learn more about these periods and processes they
49:09
are explained more completely in principles for navigating big debt crises the big debt cycle its risks and
49:16
how to deal with it need to be better understood because the really big debt crises that take the form of debt
49:22
restructurings and devaluations that come at the ends of big debt Cycles happen roughly once in a lifetime they
49:29
are not well understood relative to the short-term cycles that is why I did this study said differently what ends
49:36
long-term debt Cycles is different from what ends short-term debt Cycles so most people don't know about or acknowledge
49:42
long-term debt Cycles or worry about long-term debt Cycles ending even though they're much bigger deals than
49:48
short-term debt Cycles ending that's dangerous it's like eating fatty foods and having cholesterol accumulate in the
49:55
heart as plaque and saying that it doesn't seem to be causing trouble while it is increasing the probability of a
50:01
heart attack let's remember what is healthy which is one having private sector lenders give their credit in
50:07
exchange for debt that works well for them and creditors because the uses of the funds were profitable and two for
50:14
government borrowings to be used in ways that produce productivity gains EG in
50:19
better infrastructure education Etc that can be paid for Via tax revenue or for
50:25
the government to sometimes borrow and spend more than it takes in when the economy needs stimulation that is
50:31
followed by paying it back when conditions are strong and let's remember what isn't healthy which is one the
50:37
Central Bank chronically printing money and buying debt to make up for the shortage in demand for the debt and two
50:44
the central government chronically having large deficits that result in debt and Debt Service levels Rising
50:50
faster than the incomes in the government's case tax revenue that are required to service them in in summary
50:57
and to reiterate Goods services and investment assets can be produced bought and sold with money and credit central
51:04
banks can produce money and can influence the amount of credit in whatever quantities they want borrower
51:10
debtors ultimately require enough money and low enough interest rates for them to be able to borrow and service their
51:16
debts lender creditors require high enough interest rates and low enough default rates from the debtors in order
51:22
for them to get adequate returns to lend and be creditors this Balancing Act
51:27
becomes progressively more difficult as the sizes of the debt assets and debt liabilities both increase relative to
51:34
the incomes eventually they need to be reduced so a deleveraging happens the
51:39
best type of deleveraging is what I call a beautiful deleveraging which can be engineered by Central governments and
51:45
central banks to reduce debt burdens if the debt is in their own currencies if
51:51
the debts are denominated in a foreign currency the deleveraging is quite ugly
51:56
I would explain these later over the long term being productive and having healthy income statements I.E earning
52:03
more than one is spending and healthy balance sheets I.E having more assets than liabilities are markers of
52:11
Financial Health if you know where in the credit debt cycle each country is and how the players are likely to behave
52:18
you should be able to navigate these Cycles well the past is prologue important takeaways debt crises are
52:25
inevitable throughout history only a very few well- disciplined countries have avoided debt crises that's because
52:31
lending Is Never Done perfectly and is often done badly due to how the cycle affects people's psychology to produce
52:38
Bubbles and busts most debt crises even big ones can be managed well by Economic
52:43
Policy makers if they are well spread out all debt crises provide investment opportunities for investors if they
52:51
understand how they work and have good principles for navigating them well inevitably at the beginning of the end
52:56
of the big debt cycle when there is a lot of debt it is difficult to keep real interest rates high enough to satisfy
53:03
lender creditors without them being too high for borrower debtors and central banks try to navigate between these
53:10
choices typically during these times both the tight money economic contraction and the loose money
53:15
inflation occur and the only question is in what order in any case owning the
53:21
debt currency of overly indebted governments at such times is a bad investment central banks have to choose
53:28
between keeping money hard which will lead debtors to default on their debts which will lead to deflationary
53:34
depressions or making money soft by printing a lot of it which will devalue both it and the debt because paying off
53:41
debt with hard money causes such severe market and economic downturns when faced with this Choice central banks always
53:48
eventually choose to print and devalue money for the case studies see part two of principles for navigating big debt
53:55
crises of course each country's Central Bank can only print that country's money which brings me to my next big point if
54:03
debts are denominated in a country's own currency its Central Bank can and will print the money to alleviate the debt
54:10
crisis this allows them to manage it better than if they couldn't print the money but of course it also reduces the
54:16
value of the money the other four big forces affect how this debt cycle
54:21
transpires just as this debt cycle affects how the other four forces transpire together
54:27
thus far I have just spoken about debt Cycles because that is the subject of this study however many factors interact
54:33
to determine what happens so I couldn't ignore them and do my job well they were covered extensively in my book
54:40
principles for dealing with the changing World Order while I showed 18 measures of the major drivers of conditions in
54:46
the book The Big Five that explain almost everything are one the money
54:51
credit chart debt markets economic Cycles two the cyle of social and
54:57
political order and disorder that takes place within countries three the cycle
55:02
of order and disorder that is Manifest in the peace and War cycle that takes place between countries and four acts of
55:09
nature shocks such as droughts floods and pandemics and five human inventiveness especially of new
55:16
technologies that increase productivity the interactions between these forces
55:21
Drive how conditions change they tend to reinforce each other both upwardly and down downwardly for example periods of
55:28
Financial and economic crisis raise the odds of having periods of internal conflict and periods of internal
55:35
conflict worsen financial and economic conditions similarly periods of internal
55:40
financial problems and internal political conflicts both weaken the country that they are happening in and
55:46
if they are global increase the likelihood of international conflicts together these forces create the big
55:52
cycles of ups and downs peace and wars that UR Ur in countries and between
55:57
countries that lead to big changes in domestic and World orders these big
56:02
Rises and declines are easy to see by monitoring the 18 forces particularly the big five that I'm sharing with you
56:10
for example you can see the big evolutionary decline of great powers and their monies reflected in one the
56:17
unwavering Rises of indebtedness accompanied by the steady weakening of the types of monetary systems used to
56:24
restrain credit and debt growth motivated attempts to raise credit and economic growth and two the decline of
56:30
many indicators of Health such as the quality of Education infrastructure Law
56:36
and Order civility government Effectiveness relative to those other world powers I won't now delve into how
56:43
all these work both because doing that would be too much of a digression and because it's better explained in my book
56:49
or even in my relatively brief video both titled principles for dealing with the changing World Order I will now
56:56
delve into a description of the mechanics of the big debt cycle in numbers and equations which I will try
57:02
to describe in an easy to understand way the views expressed in this article are
57:07
