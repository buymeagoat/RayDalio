- [Narrator] Principles For Success.

An ultra mini-series adventure
0:04
in 30 minutes, and in eight episodes.

Episode one, The Call to Adventure.
THE CALL TO ADVENTURE
0:12
Before we begin, let me just establish the fact
0:15
that I don't know much relative to what I need to know.
0:19
Whatever success I've had in life
0:20
has had more to do with my knowing
0:22
how to deal with my not knowing than anything I know.
0:27
That I should be telling other people what to do
0:29
sounds kind of presumptuous to me,
0:32
but I'm going to do it,
0:33
because I believe that the principles
0:35
that have made me successful
0:37
could help others achieve their own goals.
0:40
I'm now at a stage in my own life
0:42
in which it is much more important to me
0:44
to pass along what I've learned about how to be successful
0:48
than to seek more success for myself.
0:51
What you choose to do with these principles is up to you.
0:55
You have to be an independent thinker,
0:57
because only you can develop your own principles
1:00
based on your own values.
1:03
This brings me to my first and most fundamental principle,
1:06
which is that you need to think for yourself
1:09
about what is true.
1:11
So let's get started.
1:13
Early on, I discovered I needed principles.
1:16
Principles are smart ways for handling things
1:18
that happen over and over again in similar situations.
1:21
There are principles for everything,
1:23
from skiing to parenting to cooking, and so on.
1:28
I'm going to share some of my most important,
1:31
overarching, life principles that influence
1:34
how we approach everything that we do.
1:37
I didn't start out with principles.
1:40
I acquired them over a lifetime of experiences.
1:44
Mostly, from making mistakes and reflecting on them.
1:48
My life principles are simple, but they're not complete.
1:52
I still struggle to make the best decisions,
1:55
and I still make mistakes
1:56
and learn new principles all the time.
1:59
This is the reality.
2:02
At the beginning, I needed to escape
2:04
the conventions that surrounded me,
2:07
which meant that I needed to think for myself.
2:09
Unless you want to have a life that is directed by others,
2:13
you need to decide for yourself what to do,
2:17
and you need to have the courage to do it.
2:21
But I didn't know that at first.
2:23
I only learned that from going on my adventure.
2:26
Looking back on my own journey,
2:28
I now see that time is like a river
2:31
that carries us forward into encounters with reality
2:34
that require us to make decisions.
2:37
We can't stop our movement down this river,
2:40
and we can't avoid the encounters.
2:42
We can only approach them in the best possible way.
2:46
In your lifetime, you will face millions of decisions.
2:50
The quality of your decisions will determine
2:53
the quality of your life.
2:54
Over the course of my lifetime,
2:56
the most valuable things I've learned
2:58
were the results of mistakes I reflected on
3:01
to help form principles
3:03
so I wouldn't make the same mistakes again.
3:06
These principles took me from being a very ordinary
3:09
middle class kid from Long Island
3:11
to becoming very successful
3:12
as judged by conventional measures.
3:15
They also gave me the meaningful work
3:17
and meaningful relationships that I value
3:20
even more than these conventional successes.
3:23
People often ask me how I did it.
3:25
I can assure you it wasn't because
3:27
of my uniqueness as a person.
3:29
It was the result of a unique approach to life
3:32
I believe almost anybody can adopt.
3:35
It starts with embracing reality and dealing with it.
3:40
The path you take in life is your most important decision.
3:44
In my case, I wanted my life to be great,
3:47
and I feared boredom and mediocrity
3:49
more than I feared failure.
3:52
Since I didn't start out with money,
3:54
and I didn't need much more than a bed to sleep in
3:56
and food to eat,
3:57
I could skew my decisions to pursue my adventures.
4:01
So ever since I was a kid,
4:03
I ran after the things I wanted, crashed,
4:06
got up and ran again, and crashed again,
4:10
and each time I crashed, I learned something,
4:13
got better, and crashed less.
4:16
By doing that over and over again,
4:18
I learned to love this process,
4:21
even the crashing part of it.
4:23
Through it, I encountered reality,
4:26
and I learned how to deal with it,
4:28
which inspired another one of my most fundamental principles
TRUTH IS THE ESSENTIAL FOUNDATION FOR PRODUCING GOOD OUTCOMES.
4:32
which is that truth is the essential foundation
4:36
for producing good outcomes.
4:39
By truth, I don't mean anything more
4:41
than the way the world works.
4:43
I believe that we were given the laws of reality by nature.
4:47
Humans didn't create them, but we can use them
4:50
to foster our own evolution and achieve our goals.
4:54
Realizing that made me a hyper-realist,
4:57
by which I mean I became someone
5:00
who has discovered the great rewards
5:02
of deeply understanding, accepting,
5:05
and working with reality as it is,
5:08
and not as I wish it would be.
5:11
When I say I'm a hyper-realist,
5:14
people sometimes think I'm saying
5:16
that dreams can't come true.
5:18
That's absolutely not true.
5:20
Without pursuing dreams, life is mundane.
5:24
What I mean is that, to me,
5:26
hyper-realism is the best way to choose one's dreams
5:29
and then achieve them.
5:31
Having big dreams, plus embracing reality,
5:35
plus having lots of determination
5:38
will bring you a successful life.
5:40
I believe this formula is true for everyone.
5:44
But what does a successful life look like?
5:46
We each have to decide for ourselves what success is.
5:50
I don't care whether you want to be a master of the universe
5:53
or to live under a palm tree, or anything else.
5:56
I really don't.
5:59
Each of us chooses goals based on our values
6:02
and decides on the best path to achieve them.
6:05
But we all need approaches
6:07
to making decisions that work well,
6:10
especially when facing problems, mistakes, and weaknesses
6:13
that stand in our way.
6:15
To succeed, we must embrace all our realities,
6:18
especially the harsh realities that we wish weren't true.
6:22
At first, looking at these harsh realities
6:25
caused me a lot of pain.
6:26
But I learned that this pain was just psychological,
6:30
and that my seeing things differently
6:32
made all the difference.
6:34
I came to view problems like puzzles
6:36
that would reward me if I could solve them.
6:39
They would help me deal with the problem at hand,
6:41
and they would give me principles
6:43
for dealing with similar problems in the future.
6:47
I learned to treat pain as a cue
6:50
that a great learning opportunity is at hand,
6:53
which led me to realize that pain
6:56
plus reflection equals progress.
7:00
Meditation has been invaluable
REFLECTION
7:02
in helping me see things that way.
7:05
I found that when I calmed myself down
7:07
and embraced my realities, and dealt with them,
7:11
the rewards brought me pleasure, and the pain faded.
7:15
Each of us has the unique capability to think logically,
7:19
to reflect on ourselves, and our circumstances,
7:22
and to direct our own personal evolution.
7:25
Doing this well is just a matter of following
7:28
a simple five-step process. (warm music)
THE FIVE-STEP PROCESS
7:34
We've discussed how important it is
7:35
to reflect carefully after experiencing pain.
7:39
When I did this, I was usually able to discover principles
7:43
that would prevent me from repeating
7:44
the same mistakes in the future.
7:46
And I could see that being successful
7:49
simply consisted of five steps.
7:51
Step one is to know your goals and run after them.
7:55
What is best for you depends on your nature,
7:58
so you need to really understand yourself
8:00
and know what you want to achieve in life.
8:03
Step two is to encounter the problems that stand in the way
8:06
of getting to your goals.
8:08
These problems are typically painful.
8:10
If handled badly, some of them can lead to your ruin.
8:14
But to evolve, you need to identify those problems
8:17
and not tolerate them.
8:19
Step three is to diagnose these problems
8:22
to get at their root causes.
8:24
Don't jump too quickly to solutions.
8:27
Take a step back and reflect in order to really distinguish
8:31
the symptoms from the disease.
8:33
Step four is to design a plan to eliminate the problems.
8:38
This is where you will determine
8:39
what you need to do to get around them.
8:42
And step five is to execute those designs,
8:45
pushing yourself to do what's needed
8:47
to progress toward your goal.
8:49
A successful life essentially consists
8:52
of doing these five steps over and over again.
8:54
This is your personal evolution,
8:56
and you see this process everywhere.
8:59
It's just a law of nature.
9:01
Think of any product, any organization,
9:04
or any person you know,
9:05
and you will see that this is true for them.
9:08
Evolution is simply a process of either adapting, or dying.
9:14
Conceptually, it looks just like
9:16
the five-step process I've described.
9:19
As you push through this often painful process,
9:22
you'll naturally ascend
9:23
to higher and higher levels of success.
9:26
I found that when I did it better,
9:28
my struggling never became easier,
9:31
because the more capable I became,
9:33
the greater the challenges I would take on.
9:37
Because different people are strong and weak
9:39
at different things,
9:40
most people can't do all five steps well.
9:43
Not facing this reality
9:45
means you could stretch further than you should.
9:48
And as the heights get greater,
9:50
your falls could also be greater.
9:52
(wind howling)
9:53
Sometimes terrible things happen to all of us in life.
9:57
They can ruin us, or they can profoundly improve us
10:00
depending on how we handle them.
10:03
Something like this happened to me in 1982.
10:08
We progress forward until we encounter setbacks.
10:12
Whether or not we get out of them and continue forward
10:15
or spiral downward depends on whether or not
10:18
we're willing to face the failure objectively,
10:21
and make the right decisions to turn the loop upward again.
10:25
Something terrible happened to me in 1982,
10:29
when I bet everything on a depression that never came.
10:34
(crashing) (birds chirping)
10:36
The period between 1979 and 1982
10:39
was one of extreme turbulence,
10:41
for the global economy, the markets, and for me.
10:46
And I believed that the US economy,
10:48
with the world economy tied to it,
10:50
was headed toward a catastrophe.
10:53
This view was extremely controversial.
10:56
I wanted the great upside,
10:58
and very publicly took a big risk
11:00
and was wrong, dead wrong.
11:03
After a delay, the stock market began a big bull market
11:07
that lasted 18 years,
11:09
and the US economy enjoyed the greatest growth period
11:12
in its history.
11:13
This experience was like a blow to my head
11:15
with a baseball bat.
11:17
I had to cut my losses so that my company, Bridgewater,
11:20
was left with one employee, me.
11:24
(door slams) (paper shuffles)
11:25
I was so broke, I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad
11:28
to pay my bills.
11:30
But even worse was having to let go the people
11:33
I cared so much about.
11:36
I wondered whether I should give up my dream
11:38
of working for myself and play it safe
11:41
by working for someone else in a job
11:43
that would require me to put on a tie and commute everyday.
11:46
Though I knew that for me, taking less risk
11:49
would mean having a less great life.
11:52
Being so wrong, and especially being so publicly wrong,
11:56
was painfully humbling.
11:58
I am still shocked and embarrassed by how arrogant I was
12:02
in being totally confident in a totally incorrect view.
12:08
Though I had been right much more than I had been wrong,
12:11
I let one bad bet erase all my good ones.
12:14
(dramatic orchestral music)
12:16
I thought very hard about the relationship
12:18
between risk and reward, and how to manage them.
12:22
But I couldn't see a path forward
12:24
that would give me the rewards I wanted
12:27
without unacceptable risk.
12:29
This kind of experience happens to everyone.
12:33
It will happen to you.
12:35
You will lose something, or someone
12:38
you think you can't live without.
12:40
Or you will suffer a terrible illness or injury,
12:44
or your career will fall apart before your eyes.
12:48
You might think that your life is ruined,
12:50
and there's no way to go forward.
12:53
But it will pass.
12:55
I assure you that there is always a best path forward,
13:00
and you probably just don't see it yet.
13:03
You just have to reflect well to find it.
13:06
You have to embrace your reality.
EVERYTHING IS A MACHINE
13:12
Sometimes things happen that are hard to understand.
13:15
Life often feels so difficult and complicated,
13:18
it's too much to take in all at once.
13:21
My deep pain led me to reflect deeply on my circumstances.
13:25
It also led me to reflect on nature,
13:27
because it provides a guide for what's true.
13:30
So I thought a lot about how things work,
13:33
which helped to put me, and my own circumstances,
13:37
in perspective.
13:39
I saw that at the big bang,
13:41
all the laws and forces of the universe
13:44
were created and propelled forward,
13:46
interacting with each other as a perpetual motion machine,
13:49
in which all the bits and pieces coalesce into machines
13:53
that work for a while, fall apart,
13:56
and then coalesce into new machines.
13:58
This goes on into eternity.
14:01
I saw that everything is a machine.
14:03
The structure and evolution of galaxies,
14:06
the formation of our own solar system,
14:08
the make-up of earth's geography and ecosystems,
14:12
our economies and markets, and each of us.
14:16
We individually are machines, made up of different machines.
14:20
Our circulatory system, our nervous system,
14:23
that produce our thoughts, our dreams, our emotions,
14:27
and all the other aspects of our distinct characters.
14:30
All of these different machines evolve together through time
14:34
to produce the realities we encounter every day.
14:37
And I realized that I was just one tiny bit
14:40
in one nanosecond, deciding what I should do.
14:44
While that perspective might sound very philosophical,
14:47
I found that it was very practical,
14:50
because it showed me how I could deal with my own realities
14:53
in a better way.
14:54
For example, I observed that most everything
14:57
happens over and over again in slightly different ways.
15:01
Some in obvious short-term cycles
15:04
that are easy to recognize,
15:05
so we know how to deal with them, like the 24-hour day.
15:09
Some so infrequently that they haven't occurred
15:12
in our lifetimes, and we're shocked when they do,
15:15
like the once in a 100 year storm.
15:18
And some we know exist,
15:20
but are encountering for the first time,
15:22
like the birth of our first child.
15:25
Most people mistakenly treat these situations
15:28
as being unique, and deal with them
15:30
without having proper perspective or principles
15:33
to help them get through them.
15:35
I found that if instead of dealing with these events
15:38
as one-offs, I could see each as just another one of those,
15:43
and approach them in the same way
15:45
a biologist might approach an animal.
15:47
First, identifying its species, then drawing on principles
15:51
for dealing with it appropriately.
15:53
Because I could see these events transpire
15:55
in pretty much the same ways over and over,
15:58
I could more clearly see the cause-effect relationships
16:01
that govern their behaviors,
16:03
which allowed me to develop better principles
16:05
that I could express in both words and algorithms.
16:09
I learned that while most everyone expects the future
16:12
to be a slightly modified version of the present,
16:15
it is typically very different.
16:17
That's because people are biased by recent history,
16:20
and overlook events that haven't happened in a long time,
16:23
perhaps not even in their lifetime.
16:25
But they will happen again.
16:28
With that perspective, I realized that what I missed
16:31
when I mistakenly called for a great depression
16:34
was hidden in the patterns of history,
16:36
and I could use my newfound knowledge of these patterns
16:39
to make better decisions in the future.
16:41
And when I thought about my challenge,
16:44
balancing risk and reward,
16:46
I realized that risk and reward naturally go together.
16:50
I could see that to get the most out of life,
16:52
one has to take more risk,
16:54
and that knowing how to appropriately balance
16:57
risk and reward is essential
17:00
to having the best life possible.
17:02
Imagine you were faced with the choice
17:04
of having a safe, boring life if you stay where you are,
17:08
or having a fabulous one if you take the risk
17:11
of successfully crossing a dangerous jungle.
17:15
That is essentially the choice we all face.
17:18
For me, the choice was clear,
17:20
but that doesn't mean the path forward
17:22
was without challenges.
17:24
I still needed to face two big barriers
17:26
that we all must face.
17:28
(peaceful music)
EPISODE 4 YOUR TWO BIGGEST BARRIERS
17:30
I can't tell you which path in life is best for you,
17:34
because I don't know how important it is
17:36
for you to achieve big goals
17:38
relative to how important it is for you
17:40
to avoid the pains required to get them.
17:43
This is the courage I spoke of earlier,
17:46
and we each have to feel these things out for ourselves.
17:49
After my big mistake in calling for a depression,
17:52
I had come to one of life's forks in the road, as we all do.
17:56
If I made the choice to take a normal job and play it safe,
18:00
I would have ended up with a very different life
18:02
than the one I had.
18:04
(door slams) (paper shuffles)
18:05
But as long as I could pay the rent,
18:07
put food on the table, and educate my kids,
18:10
the only choice for me was to risk crossing the jungle
18:13
in pursuit of the best life possible.
18:16
My big mistake in betting on a depression
18:19
gave me a healthy fear of being wrong.
18:22
In other words, it gave me deep humility,
18:26
which was exactly what I needed.
18:28
At the same time, it didn't stop me
18:30
from aggressively going after the things I wanted.
18:33
To succeed, I needed to see more than I alone could see.
18:37
(strikes match) (flame hisses)
18:38
But standing in my way of doing that
18:40
were the two biggest barriers everyone faces.
18:44
Our ego and blind spot barriers.
18:48
These barriers exist because of how our brains work.
18:51
First, let's explore the ego barrier.
18:54
When I refer to your ego barrier,
18:56
I'm talking about the parts of your brain that prevent you
18:59
from acknowledging your weaknesses objectively,
19:02
so that you can figure out how to deal with them.
19:05
Your deepest seated needs and fears
19:07
reside in areas of your brain that control your emotions
19:11
and are not accessible
19:12
to your higher-level conscious awareness.
19:16
And because our need to be right can be more important
19:19
than our need to find out what's true,
19:21
we like to believe our own opinions
19:24
without properly stress-testing them.
19:26
We especially don't like to look
19:28
at our mistakes and weaknesses.
19:30
We are instinctively prone to react to explorations of them
19:35
as though they're attacks.
19:36
We get angry, even though it would be more logical
19:40
for us to be open to feedback from others.
19:42
This leads to our making inferior decisions, learning less,
19:46
and falling short of our potentials.
19:49
The second is the blind spot barrier.
19:52
Everyone has blind spots.
19:54
The blind spot barrier is when a person believes
19:56
he or she can see everything.
19:58
But it's a simple fact that no one alone
20:01
can see a complete picture of reality.
20:04
Naturally, people can't appreciate what they can't see,
20:08
just as we all have different ranges
20:10
for singing, hearing pitch, and seeing colors,
20:13
we have different ranges
20:14
for seeing and understanding things.
20:17
For example, while some people are better
20:20
at seeing the big picture, others excel at seeing details.
20:26
Some are linear thinkers, and others are more lateral.
20:29
While some are creative but not reliable,
20:33
others are reliable but not creative, and so on.
20:37
Because of how are brains are wired differently,
20:39
everyone perceives the world around them differently.
20:43
By doing what comes naturally to us,
20:46
we fail to account for our weaknesses and we crash.
20:50
Either we keep doing that, or we change.
20:53
Aristotle defined tragedy as a terrible outcome
20:57
arising from a person's fatal flaw.
20:59
A flaw, that had it been fixed,
21:02
would have instead led to a wonderful outcome.
21:06
In my opinion, these two barriers are the main impediments
21:09
that get in the way of good decision-making.
EPISODE BE RADICALLY OPEN-MINDED
21:13
(noble orchestral music)
21:16
Taking risks and occasionally being ruined wasn't acceptable
21:21
and neither was not taking risks
21:23
and not having exceptional results.
21:26
I needed an approach that would give me
21:27
the exceptional upside without also giving me
21:30
the exceptional downside.
21:33
When I discovered it, it turned out to be my holy grail.
21:37
To get it, I needed to replace the joy of being proven right
21:41
with the joy of learning what's true.
21:46
This need prompted me to seek out
21:48
the most thoughtful people I could find
21:50
who disagreed with me.
21:52
I didn't care about their conclusions,
21:54
I just wanted to see things through their eyes,
21:57
and to have them see things through my eyes,
22:00
so that together we could hash things out
22:02
to discover what's true.
22:05
In other words, what I wanted most from them
22:08
was thoughtful disagreement.
22:11
Going from seeing things through just my eyes,
22:14
to seeing things through the eyes of these thoughtful people
22:18
was like going from seeing things in black and white
22:20
to seeing them in color.
22:22
(birds chirping)
22:24
The world lit up.
22:26
(growling)
22:28
(wings flapping)
22:29
That's when I realized that the best way
22:31
to go through the jungle of life is with insightful people
22:35
who see things differently from me.
22:38
Think about the five-step process I described earlier.
22:41
As I said, because we are wired so differently,
22:44
not everyone can do all the five steps well.
22:47
But you don't have to do them all alone.
22:50
You can get help from others
22:52
who are good at what you're not,
22:54
who are wired to perceive things you can't.
22:58
All you need to do is let go of your attachment
23:00
to having the right answers yourself,
23:03
and use your fear of being wrong
23:04
to become open-minded to these other views.
23:10
In this way, you could point out the risks and opportunities
23:13
that you would individually miss.
23:16
I found that taking this radically open-minded approach
23:19
and believability-weighting people's thinking
23:22
significantly increased my probabilities
23:25
of making the best decisions possible.
23:27
This enabled me to ascend
23:29
to greater heights and greater challenges.
23:32
In the past, I would have always wanted
23:34
to do what I, myself, thought was best.
23:37
But now I sought out
23:39
the strongest independent thinkers I could find.
23:41
I still do.
23:43
There is nothing better to be on a shared mission
23:46
with extraordinary people who can be radically truthful
23:50
and radically transparent with each other.
23:53
This approach led me to create a company
23:55
with the unique idea meritocracy,
23:57
operating in a unique way, that produced unique successes.
24:02
In an idea meritocracy, you get the best of everybody.
24:06
Everyone thinks independently,
24:09
then we work through our disagreements
24:11
to get at what's best.
24:13
However, not every opinion is equally valuable.
24:16
And we had to learn to distinguish
24:18
between good ideas and bad ones to get the best decisions.
24:22
In other words, we needed to believability-weight
24:25
people's thinking.
24:27
But that's another story I will explain
24:29
in my work principles.
24:31
Right now, there are many wonderful opportunities
24:34
and dangerous risks surrounding you that you don't see.
24:39
If you saw them free of the distortions
24:42
produced by your ego or your blind spots,
24:45
you would be able to deal with them more effectively.
24:48
If you could acquire this ability,
24:50
and with practice you can,
24:52
you will radically improve your life.
EPISODE STRUGGLE WELL
24:57
So far I described
24:58
how I learned to confront my own realities,
25:01
my problems, my mistakes, and weaknesses.
25:04
And how I surrounded myself with others
25:07
who could do things better than I could.
25:09
This was the most effective way I discovered
25:12
for making great decisions.
25:15
This is not the normal way of being,
25:17
but through this approach, I became very successful.
25:20
And being successful enabled me to meet
25:23
extraordinarily successful people and see how they think.
25:28
I've discovered that their journeys were similar to mine.
25:31
You might not know it, but they all struggled,
25:35
and they all have weaknesses
25:37
that they all get around by working with people
25:40
who see risks and opportunities that they would miss.
25:43
Over time, I leaned that by nature,
25:45
most people's greatest strengths
25:47
are also connected to their most significant weaknesses.
25:51
And striving hard for big things
25:53
is bound to lead you to painful falls.
25:56
It's just part of the process.
25:59
Such setbacks will test you.
26:01
They sort people.
26:03
Some think hard about what caused their setbacks,
26:07
learn lessons, and continue progressing toward their goals,
26:11
while others decide that this game is not for them,
26:14
and get off the field.
26:16
I've come to realize that success
26:18
is not a matter of attaining one's goals.
26:22
I've found that when I reached
26:23
each new higher level of success,
26:26
I rarely remained satisfied.
26:28
The things we are striving for are just the bait.
26:32
Struggling to get them forces us to evolve,
26:35
and it is this struggle
26:37
toward personal evolution with others that is the reward.
26:41
I no longer wanted to get across the jungle,
26:44
but instead wanted to find greater and greater challenges
26:47
to go after, surrounded by great people working together
26:52
on a shared journey.
26:54
Eventually the success of the mission
26:56
and the well-being of the people alongside me
26:59
became more important than my own success.
27:03
I also started to see beyond myself,
27:05
and wanted others to be successful when I'm no longer here.
27:10
I realized that if I fail to do that, I will be a failure.
27:15
I struggle with this now.
27:18
We all struggle with different things at different times,
27:21
until we either choose to give up, or until we die
27:24
and become part of the larger evolutionary story.
27:28
This is how all machines work,
27:30
and are recycled through time.
27:32
When a machine breaks down,
27:34
its parts go back into the system
27:36
to become parts of new machines
27:38
that also evolve through time.
27:41
Sometimes this makes us sad,
27:43
because we become very attached to our machines.
27:46
But if you look at it from the higher level,
27:48
it's really beautiful to observe
27:50
how the machine of evolution works.
27:53
Now you must decide for yourself how you will evolve.
27:58
Forget about where these principles came from.
28:01
Just assess whether or not they are useful to you,
28:04
and evolve them to suit your own needs.
28:07
As with all of life's decisions,
28:09
what you do with them is ultimately up to you.
28:13
My only hope for you is that you have the courage
28:16
to struggle and evolve well
28:18
to make your life as great as it can be.
28:22
Thank you, and goodbye.
