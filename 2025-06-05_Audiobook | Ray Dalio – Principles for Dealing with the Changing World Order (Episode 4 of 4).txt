to the end of the book. Let's begin. Part two, how the world has
Chapter 8: The Last 500 Years in a Tiny Nutshell
0:26
worked over the last 500 years. Chapter 8, the last 500 years in a tiny
0:35
nutshell. In part one, I described how I believe the perpetual motion machine
0:40
works. In part two, I will show you what this perpetual motion machine has
0:45
produced over the last 500 years of history. Just as I did in part one, I'll
0:51
start by conveying everything in a tiny nutshell. This chapter will set the
0:56
stage for the remaining chapters of part two, which will cover in detail how the big cycle played out in the Dutch,
1:02
British, American, and Chinese cases. Finally, in part three, I will attempt
1:08
to squint into the future by sharing with you what my model says about a number of the leading countries today.
1:15
But before we get there, we need to go back to 1500 to get a better picture of
1:20
what the world was like when this story begins.
1:26
The world in 1500. The world was very different in
1:31
1500. Yet, it operated the same way it does now. That's because while things
1:36
have evolved a lot since 1500, they've done so in the same ways they always have, with evolutionary uptrends
1:43
producing advancements and big cycles creating swings and bumps around the uptrends.
1:49
A few of the most important ways that the world was different in 1500 were the world was much bigger
1:57
then 500 years ago one could travel about 25 m in a day on horseback. Today
2:05
it is possible to travel to the other side of the world in the same amount of time. The Apollo astronauts traveled to
2:12
the moon and back much faster than it took a traveler to get from Paris to Rome in 1500. As a result, the
2:19
geographic areas of relevance, for example, who could impact whom were much
2:25
smaller, so the world seemed much bigger. Europe was one world, Russia was
2:31
another, and China and the areas around it were an even more remote world. States that, in retrospect seem
2:38
tiny and numerous did not seem that way at all at the time. Because national
2:43
boundaries didn't exist as they do today, there were almost constant fights with neighbors over wealth and power in
2:50
their neighborhoods. But in 1500, that picture was changing quickly. The European
2:56
powers were well into their age of exploration, which was led by the Portuguese and the Spanish and brought
3:02
them into contact with faraway empires. Like all periods of great evolution, the
3:08
age of exploration was enabled by technological developments that could make people rich. In this case, the
3:15
invention of ships that could travel the world to accumulate riches by trading with and taking wealth from those who
3:22
the explorers encountered. At the time, wealthy rulers funded the expeditions in
3:28
exchange for a share of the bounty that the explorers brought back with them. Countries didn't exist. Instead,
3:35
territories were run by families. Back in 1500, there were no
3:41
sovereign states with borders and ruling orders. They hadn't been invented yet.
3:46
Instead, there were big family estates called kingdoms and dynasties run by kings and emperors that almost
3:53
constantly fought with their neighbors for wealth and power. When a kingdom conquered, grew, and encompassed enough
4:00
area, it was called an empire. Because the ruling order was centered around
4:06
families, kingdoms and dynasties at that time could inherit other lands if their rulers died and there was no closer
4:13
relative, similar to how one would inherit property or a family company today. Arranged marriages were logical
4:20
ways the empire could stay in the hands of a tighter family group rather than branching off and dissipating over the
4:28
generations. Religions and religious leaders were much more powerful and
4:33
science as we know it today didn't exist. In most of the world, the elites,
4:38
that is the small percentage of the population who had most of the wealth and power, consisted of monarchs who
4:45
supposedly gained their power from the divine, the clergy who represented the divine, and the landowning nobles who
4:52
oversaw the peasants and largely treated them like oxmen working the land. The
4:58
monarchs had ministers, bureaucracies, and militaries that controlled and defended their territories for them.
5:05
Though the Europeans and the Chinese were on opposite sides of the world and had virtually no contact with each
5:11
other, they operated in essentially the same way. Though China's institutions were bigger, more developed, and less
5:18
religious than Europe's, the world was much less egalitarian.
5:24
The ideas that a all people should be treated equally and b judged by the law
5:30
didn't exist at the time. This was true both within kingdoms and between them.
5:36
In both cases, power through arms and violence ruled the day. Up until the
5:41
1300s and 1400s, surfom, that is peasants being essentially treated as
5:47
the property of their rulers, existed in most of Western Europe, which meant that the only way for most people to assert
5:54
their power was through revolt. While this had largely changed by 1500, the rights afforded to common
6:01
people remained weak until the Enlightenment in the 1700s.
6:08
The world's empires in 1500.
6:14
Europe. The Hapsburg family dynasty controlled Spain and all the territories
6:19
that Spain controlled, plus a collection of territories that formed the Holy Roman Empire. This included parts of
6:26
what we now call the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Austria. It
6:31
was the Western world's most powerful empire. The Valwis later Bourban family dynasty
6:39
which was the main rival to the Habsburgs controlled France. This led to a lot of fighting between the
6:46
families. The Tutor dynasty controlled England which was not yet an important force in Europe though it was growing in
6:54
strength. Florence, Venice and Milan which were frequently run as republics with prominent families were where the
7:01
action was. Most of the financial, commercial, intellectual and artistic innovation coming out of Europe in 1500
7:09
originated in these states. They were very rich and played a central role in shaping Europe and the Western world at
7:16
this time and for centuries to come because of the revolutionary ideas they fostered. Ideas I will explore in more
7:22
detail later. The papal states were run by the pope and the Catholic Church. Throughout
7:29
Christian Europe, relationships between monarchs, nobles, and the church followed the typical formula of elites
7:36
working in mutually supportive ways to drive the ruling orders to their benefit. As a result of this, the church
7:43
acquired vast wealth, which it got mostly from poor peasants who gave money to the church through the system of
7:49
tithes and worked without pay on church agricultural lands.
7:55
The Ruric dynasty and later the Romanovs ruled Russia which was a peripheral
8:00
power at the time and seemed remote to Europeans. The Ottoman Empire named
8:07
after its ruling family was centered in Constantinople which it had conquered in
8:14
1453. Additionally, there were many hundreds perhaps thousands of familyrun
8:19
states across Europe. They fought all the time because each had to constantly defend and fight one's neighbors. Allies
8:26
and enemies were always important and constantly changing. The map found in the PDF shows
8:33
the major powers in Europe in 1550. There were many more small states we
8:38
couldn't fit on the map on the next PDF.
8:44
Asia. The Ming Dynasty controlled almost all of China and was the most advanced
8:49
and powerful empire in the world. Like European empires, it was family
8:54
controlled with an emperor who had the mandate of heaven. The emperor oversaw a
9:00
bureaucracy that was run and protected by ministers and military leaders who worked in symbiotic, though sometimes
9:07
contentious, relationships with landowning noble families who oversaw peasant workers. In 1500, the Ming
9:15
dynasty was approaching its peak and was leaps and bounds ahead of Europe in wealth, technology, and power. It had
9:22
enormous cultural and political influence all over East Asia and Japan.
9:28
By the way, the existence of familial relationships in a Chinese dynasty should not be mistaken for loving and
9:35
caring relationships, as just like in Europe, fights between family members for control of dynasties were brutal and
9:42
often to the death. At the time, Confucian scholars were then seen to be near the top of the
9:49
social hierarchy, which helped them get ahead in politics. To get ahead, one
9:55
needed to study Confucianism in depth and pass highly competitive exams.
10:00
Political decisions were frequently based on rulers interpretations of Confucian ideals. Neo Confucianism,
10:08
which was dominant at the time, shifted the focus of the belief system toward a more rational, philosophical, academic,
10:15
and humanistic form. This way of thinking which was practical, evidence-based and scientific was a key
10:22
reason China pulled so far ahead of Europe in the Middle Ages. At the time,
10:28
scholars and scientists had significant power which led to remarkable technological advances. Gunpowder, the
10:35
printing press, architecture, and more. Literacy rates were extremely high
10:40
relative to other places at the time. And China was also advanced in medicine.
10:46
For example, it had a widespread program of fighting smallox infection via an early form of vaccination centuries
10:53
before Europe. Its financial system was relatively welldeveloped with early
10:59
forms of corporations and banks, a history of using and misusing printed
11:04
money, and relatively sophisticated financial markets. And it was militarily
11:10
very strong. The Ming dynasty had the largest navy in the world and a standing
11:15
army of a million troops. In his wonderful book, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, historian
11:22
Paul Kennedy described it well. Of all the civilizations of preodern times, none appeared more
11:30
advanced, none felt more superior than that of China. Its considerable
11:36
population 100 to 130 million compared with Europe's 50 to 55 million in the
11:42
15th century, its remarkable culture, its exceedingly fertile and irrigated
11:47
plains linked by a splendid canal system since the 11th century and its unified
11:53
hierarchic administration run by a welleducated confusion bureaucracy had
11:59
given a coherence and sophistication to Chinese society which was the envy of foreign visitors.
12:05
s. Ironically and typically, the enormity of the Ming dynasty's wealth
12:11
and power is one possible explanation of what eventually led to its fall.
12:16
Believing that they did not need anything else, the emperors put an end to China's exploration of the world,
12:23
closed its doors and retired to lives of pleasure, and turned over the running of
12:28
government to their ministers and unics, which led to dysfunctional infighting, corruption, weakness, and vulnerability
12:35
to attack. There was a shift away from pragmatic scientific study and innovation toward
12:42
pedantic scholarship. As we'll see in chapter 12, this helped drive the decline of China
12:49
relative to Europe. See a map of Ming China in the attached
12:56
PDF. Across the rest of Asia, the story in 1500 was one of fragmentation.
13:02
India was divided among several kingdoms including the Delhi Sultenate in the north and the Hindu Vijj Anagara Empire
13:09
in the south. It was not an empire of note though it was about to be as in the
13:15
1520s the Mughal Empire began its conquest of India eventually leading it
13:20
to be among the world's most powerful. Likewise, Japan in 1500 was divided into
13:26
many entities experienced civil war and was isolated. So it too was not a power
13:31
of note. The Middle East. The Ottoman Empire mentioned
13:38
before also came to control much of the Middle East by the mid 1500s with a key
13:44
rival in the new Safavidid dynasty of Persia, modern-day
13:49
Iran. The Americas. The largest empires were the Aztec Empire centered in Mexico. Its
13:58
capital Tenno Titlan probably had a greater population than any city in Europe at the time and the Incan Empire
14:05
in South America. But soon the Europeans arrived, devastating both powers and
14:11
leading to the emergence of new colonies, including the seedlings of what would become the United States 276
14:18
years later. Africa, a vast continent three times
14:26
bigger than Europe, was divided into dozens of kingdoms, often separated by large, sparsely populated areas. The
14:34
biggest in the year 1500 was the Songhai Empire in West Africa, which had a reputation as a center of trade and
14:41
Islamic scholarship. That was the lay of the land in 1500. The world order was about
14:48
to change in very big ways. What has happened since
14:55
1500? As you might imagine, there are far too many important things that have happened since 1500 for me to fit into
15:02
this tiny nutshell. However, I can hit the highlights of the story of how the
15:08
world changed from 1500 until now with an emphasis on the key themes and shifts
15:13
I will be expanding on in the following chapters. The most important changes were the
15:19
changes in thinking that led to people changing behaviors, particularly about how wealth and power should be shared.
15:26
They were what made the story transpire as it did. It is easy to identify the
15:32
biggest periods of change because they are generally called revolutions and ages, though sometimes they are called
15:38
other things. When listening to this short summary of the last 500 years,
15:44
notice both the evolutions and the cycles. You will see that there were both one, several revolutions in ways of
15:51
thinking that led to tremendous evolution and progress over hundreds of years, and two, many cycles of peaceful
15:59
and prosperous periods alternating with depressions and wars that marked the ends of old orders and beginnings of new
16:07
ones. The commercial revolution 1100s to
16:14
1500s. The commercial revolution was the move away from a solely agriculture-based economy to one that
16:21
included trade in a variety of goods. This evolution began in the 12th century
16:26
and by 1500 it was centered in the Italian citystates due to a confluence of two factors that enabled them to
16:34
become terrifically wealthy. First, the wars between Christian Europe and the
16:39
Ottoman Empire significantly slowed land trade, especially for spices and luxuries, between Europe and the rest of
16:46
the world, which created a significant opening for maritime trade. Second, a
16:52
number of Italian citystates developed republican governments modeled after the Roman Republic. Their governments were
16:59
more inventive and responsive than those in the rest of Europe, which allowed a strong merchant class to
17:05
develop. Venice was a prime example of this, as its governance system was designed with multiple checks and
17:12
balances to ensure that there was a more meritocratic approach to government than existed in the rest of Europe. Venice's
17:20
leader, called the Doge, did not have the right to name a successor and was restricted from bringing family members
17:26
into government. New dojes were chosen by vote by a series of committees whose
17:31
members in some cases were chosen by lot from among several hundred aristocratic
17:36
families. The Italians produced well functioning capital markets supported by
17:42
new advances in bookkeeping and impartial institutions to enforce contracts.
17:47
While private and government borrowing weren't new leading up to 1500, they tended to take place as bilateral deals
17:54
between wealthy citizens and defaults on creditors or the expulsion and even
18:00
execution of them were extremely common. Because those who made money from trade,
18:05
the merchant class could benefit from a well functioning financial system in which savings could be put into
18:11
investments that fueled productivity. They created a number of financial innovations, including credit
18:19
markets. With the proceeds from trade flowing in and a need for standardized coinage, coins minted in the Italian
18:26
citystates, especially Florence's gold floren were of solid value, were well
18:32
recognized as such, and as a result began to be accepted as global currencies. On the basis of their solid
18:39
currencies, these city states developed effective lending and a publicly traded bond
18:45
market. Venice established a perpetual bond early in the 12th century with a 5%
18:50
coupon that the government would either issue, that is borrow, or purchase back depending on the finances or needs of
18:57
the time. Venice's merchants owned the bonds and had significant influence on
19:03
the government, so default could only be a last resort. The centuries in which
19:08
the bond existed without defaults gave lenders confidence in it and institutions for trading bonds in
19:14
secondary markets made it a liquid form of investment. The ability to borrow
19:20
quickly at reasonable rates was an enormous boon to Venice. Though Venice eventually defaulted after losing a
19:27
series of wars around 1500, liquid bond markets caught on elsewhere, including
19:32
in the Netherlands and in the UK. The Renaissance 1300s to
19:40
1600s. A new way of thinking in many respects modeled after the ancient Greeks and Romans started in Italian
19:48
citystates around 1300 and passed through Europe until the 1600s in a
19:53
period known as the Renaissance. Renaissance thinkers made a big pivot toward using logical reasoning instead
20:00
of divine intention as the way to explain how the world works. This shift
20:06
contributed to dizzyingly fast discoveries that led to artistic and technological advances in Europe. It
20:13
began in the citystates of northern Italy where the commercial revolution had created riches that led to advances
20:19
in trade, production, and banking enabled by intellectualism and creativity.
20:26
The Renaissance was one of history's greatest cases of a self-reinforcing cycle I described in chapter 5. Peaceful
20:33
periods in which creativity and commerce reinforce each other to produce an economic boom and great
20:41
advancements. In the middle of it and propelling it forward were people and families like the Medachi who were
20:47
merchants and bankers, not feudal kings. They used their riches to support the
20:52
arts, architecture, and science. The Medachi family, who ruled
20:58
and developed Florence during the period, though Florence technically remained a republic for much of their
21:04
rule, acquired their wealth and power as business leaders and bankers. The
21:09
Medachi used their wealth, power, and smarts to acquire more wealth and power and to contribute enormously to the arts
21:16
and sciences. They also acquired significant political power in Europe.
21:21
For example, to gain power andor to provide public service, four popes came
21:26
from the Meduchi family during their reign. A number of Medi were themselves artists and political leaders who looked
21:34
to help not only the rich but also the middle and poorer classes in the city.
21:39
However, like many multigenerational families and monarchies, after a few generations, a weak head of the family
21:46
and leader of the state, together with perceived excesses at a time of economic stress, led to a revolution. The Mediche
21:54
lost control of Florence on several occasions. While the Mediche returned to power over the subsequent three
22:01
centuries, and the Renaissance continued, they struggled and failed in the mid6th century as a result of wars.
22:08
changing trade routes and bad loan making which damaged their finances and of changes in social norms and political
22:17
practices. Alongside the flourishing in art and architecture were huge advances
22:22
in science, technology and business. Knowledge and ideas spread rapidly
22:27
because of the invention of the printing press in the mid 15th century. See the attached PDF graph for
22:34
reference. By the way, many of the European Renaissance innovations had already been
22:40
in place in China for centuries because the Chinese discovered the key elements to produce it. For example, the printing
22:47
press, the scientific method, and the meritocratic placements of people in jobs much earlier.
22:54
One can think of China's Neo Confucianism described earlier as being like China's Renaissance because as in
23:01
Europe's Renaissance, it led to more logic and evidence-based thinking and more inventive rather than religious
23:09
worldviews. As the new ideas spread across Europe in the late 16th and early
23:14
17th centuries, luminaries such as Shakespeare and Francis Bacon in England, Deart in France, and Arasmus in
23:22
the Netherlands had broad impacts. Living standards rose dramatically,
23:27
though much more for the elites than for peasants. In Italy, this period of
23:32
relative peace and prosperity eventually led to excesses, decadence, and decline
23:38
as the citystates became less competitive and their financial conditions
23:45
deteriorated. The age of exploration and colonialism 1400s to 1700s.
23:52
The age of exploration began in the 1400s when Europeans traveled all over
23:57
the world in search of wealth, creating widespread contact between many different peoples for the first time and
24:03
beginning to shrink the world. It roughly coincided with the Renaissance
24:08
because the technological marvels of the Renaissance translated into advancements in ship building and navigation and the
24:15
riches that those ships brought back financed further Renaissance advancements.
24:21
Ruling families supported these money-making explorations and split the profits with explorers. For example,
24:28
Henry the Navigator, the brother of the head of the Portuguese royal family, sponsored some of the earliest voyages
24:34
and established a trading empire in Africa and Asia. Spain followed suit,
24:40
swiftly conquering and colonizing significant portions of the Western Hemisphere, including the precious
24:46
metalrich Aztec and Incan empires. Though Portugal and Spain were rivals,
24:51
the unexplored world was huge, and when they had disputes, they were successfully
24:57
mediated. Spain's integration into the Habsburg Empire and its control over highly profitable silver mines made it
25:05
stronger than Portugal in the 1500s, and for a roughly 60-year period, starting
25:10
in the late 1500s, the Habsburg king ruled Portugal as well.
25:15
Both translated their wealth into golden ages of art and technology. The Spanish
25:21
Empire grew so large it became known as the empire on which the sun never sets.
25:26
An expression that would later be used to describe the British Empire. As European nations found ways
25:33
to make their explorations more profitable, the rise of global trade transformed their economies.
25:40
Most notably, the flow of new riches, particularly silver, to Europe fueled a
25:45
rise in prices for basic goods and services. Referred to as the Spanish price revolution, Europe went from
25:52
hundreds of years of steady prices to a doubling of prices every few decades, a
25:58
reminder of how big shifts can have economic impacts that seem unimaginable based on one's most recent
26:06
experiences. This can be seen in the next PDF charts.
26:11
Eventually, this push toward exploration led Europe to trade with and exploit Asia, most notably China, Japan, and the
26:19
Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese were the first of these explorers to approach China in 1513, although other European
26:27
explorers like Marco Polo had been in contact before. Europeans were dazzled by the
26:34
quality of Chinese porcelain, silk, and other goods, which became highly sought after. But the Chinese weren't
26:40
interested in buying European goods, which they considered inferior. However, they eagerly accepted
26:47
silver, which was money in China as well as in Europe, as payment. As we'll cover
26:52
later, China struggled for centuries with shortages of the precious metals it needed to have a sufficient supply of
26:58
money. However, the Europeans didn't have enough silver to trade, and the Chinese weren't interested in other
27:05
goods, which eventually led to the opium wars and other interesting stories that we will explore
27:12
later. China's Ming Dynasty had its own version of the age of exploration, but
27:17
abandoned it. Starting in the early 1400s, Ming Dynasty Emperor Yangla
27:23
empowered his most trusted admiral, Jang Ha, to lead seven major naval
27:28
expeditions, treasure voyages around the world. Though not colonizing
27:34
expeditions, and historians debate the extent to which they were commercial, these naval missions helped project
27:40
China's power abroad. Yangla's navy was the largest and most sophisticated in
27:46
the world, featuring larger and better constructed ships than any country in Europe would produce for at least a
27:53
century. China's international influence, as indicated by the number of foreign cities engaged in formal
28:00
tributary relationships with the mainland increased rapidly. However, the Ming emperors
28:06
chose to end these voyages and pulled the empire into itself. It remains a
28:12
matter of conjecture whether that is because Yanga's military and naval expeditions were expensive or because
28:18
the emperors believed that they had all they needed within China. So there was no need for this
28:24
exploration. This is illustrated in the next chart in the PDF. The result of this pullback was an
28:32
age of isolationism in China and in Japan as well where it was called
28:37
Sakoku. For the next several centuries, China and Japan broadly moved away in
28:42
fits and starts from openness toward foreigners and toward distance and
28:49
isolation. The Reformation 1517 to 1648.
28:55
Beginning in the 1500s in Europe, Protestant religious movements initiated a revolution against the Roman Catholic
29:02
Church, which contributed to a series of wars and the bringing down of the thenexisting European order. As
29:09
previously explained, at the time, the existing order consisted of monarchs, nobles, and the church in symbiotic
29:16
relationships. The Reformation took aim at the power and corruption of the Roman
29:21
Catholic Church and sought an independent religion in which people dealt with God directly rather than one
29:28
mediated by the church's rules. At the time, many Catholic bishops and other
29:33
senior clergy lived like princes and palaces, and the church sold indulgences, a supposed reduction in
29:40
time people would have to spend in purgatory. The Roman Catholic Church was a nation
29:46
as much as it was a religion directly governing a sizable share of modern Italy, the Papal
29:53
States. The Reformation started in 1517 when Martin Luther published his 95
29:59
thesis challenging the papal monopoly on the interpretation of the Bible and on
30:04
papal power in general. When he refused to recant his ideas, he was declared a
30:09
heretic and excommunicated. His ideas and those of other theologians nonetheless took hold
30:16
in large parts of Europe thanks to the political support of key nobles as well as the new printing press
30:23
technology. That move together with the usual constant fighting for power broke
30:28
down the existing European world order in virtually all the major
30:34
Christian powers. The immediate impact of the reformation was increased internal conflict and instability. And
30:41
the instability extended between countries too. The wars of religion were
30:46
intertwined with the wars against the existing orders and existing elites.
30:51
They included an extended civil war in France in which an estimated 3 million people died and later contributed to an
30:58
extended civil war in the UK. In the end, the Reformation led to Protestants
31:04
earning substantial rights and freedoms. It also undermined the power of the Holy
31:09
Roman Empire and the Habsburgs, left Germany with deep divisions that would continue to build through the end of the
31:16
incredibly brutal 30 Years War in the mid600s and led to civil wars for over a
31:22
100red years. As is typical, the big war led to a new order which was followed by
31:28
a period of peace and prosperity. The new world order following the 30
31:35
Years War 1648. On its surface, the 30 Years War
31:41
pitted Protestant countries against Catholic ones. However, the full story was more complicated with wider
31:47
geopolitical interests related to wealth and power playing a role of who lined up with whom. At the end of the war, the
31:55
new order was laid out at the peace of Westfalia. The most important breakthroughs that
32:00
came from it were the establishment of geographic borders and the sovereign rights of the people within those
32:06
borders to decide what happens in their domains. Like most periods after major
32:12
wars and the establishment of new orders, there was an extended time of peace between countries, the Dutch
32:18
emerging from the chaos as the leading global economic power. However, the
32:23
battles for wealth and power, most importantly between declining monarchies and their subjects, continued across the
32:32
continent. The invention of capitalism 1600s, beginning with the Dutch, the
32:39
development of publicly available and popularly used equity markets allowed savers to effectively transfer their
32:46
buying power to entrepreneurs who could put that buying power to productive and profitable use.
32:52
This significantly improved the allocation of resources and was stimulative to economies because it
32:58
produced new buying power. It also produced the capital market cycles.
33:04
While there were many elements involved in the creation of capitalism, a series of related economic and financial
33:10
developments, most notably the developments of publicly traded stock and bonds markets, such as the opening
33:17
of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in6002 and the Bank of England's first government bond issuance to fund the war
33:24
with France in 1694 are associated with it. Along with the advances of the
33:30
scientific revolution, the invention of capitalism was a key reason behind the shift from slow real GDP growth to the
33:37
faster growth as seen in the chart I showed in chapter 1. We will explore this innovation and its tremendous
33:44
impact in more detail in the following chapter. The scientific revolution 1500s
33:52
to 1600s. The scientific revolution was an extension of the Renaissance era shift
33:59
from finding truth in religion to finding truth in logical reasoning and the reformation's drive to question
34:05
authority and think for oneself. These factors led to the development of the
34:11
scientific method which improved humanity's understanding of the world, establishing protocols by which
34:17
scientific discoveries could be investigated and proven and ushering in many discoveries that raised living
34:23
standards. The scientific method was pioneered by Francis Bacon in the early 1600s. Though
34:30
many important advances in astronomy, particularly the work of Capernacus and Galileo, took place earlier in the
34:37
1500s. These discoveries vastly expanded European knowledge about the solar
34:43
system for the first time since the Greco Roman period and were paralleled by many others across anatomy,
34:49
mathematics, physics, for example, Isaac Newton's laws of motion and many other
34:54
fields. European governments began to support and sponsor this research with
35:00
the most famous example being the Royal Society in the UK which was founded in 1660 and proved instrumental in
35:07
promoting the exchange of ideas and discoveries. Newton was its president from 1703 to
35:14
1727. Over the centuries to come, the discoveries of the scientific revolution helped unleash economic growth and
35:21
greater competitiveness for the major European powers, particularly the UK.
35:27
The ideas and methods that underpinned the revolution were applied to more and more fields throughout the movement
35:33
known as the enlightenment. The first industrial revolution 1700s to
35:42
1800s. Beginning in the UK in the 1700s, freeing people to be inventive and
35:47
productive and providing them with capital led many societies to shift to new machine-based manufacturing
35:54
processes, creating the first sustained and widespread period of productivity improvement in thousands of years. These
36:02
improvements began with agricultural inventions that increased productivity which led to a population boom and a
36:09
secular shift toward urbanization as the labor intensity of farming declined. As people flocked to cities,
36:16
industry benefited from the steadily increasing supply of labor, creating a virtuous cycle and leading to shifts in
36:24
wealth and power both within and between nations. The new urban populations needed new
36:30
types of goods and services, which required the government to get bigger and spend money on things like housing,
36:36
sanitation, and education, as well as on the infrastructure for the new industrial capitalist system, such as
36:43
courts, regulators, and central banks. Power moved into the hands of central
36:48
government bureaucrats and the capitalists who controlled the means of production.
36:54
Geopolitically, these developments most helped the UK, which pioneered many of the most important innovations. The UK
37:01
caught up to the Netherlands in output per capita around 1800 before overtaking
37:07
them in the mid-9th century when the British Empire approached its peak share of world output around 20%.
37:16
The Enlightenment and the Age of Revolutions, 1600s to
37:22
1700s. Also known as the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment was essentially the
37:27
scientific method applied to how humans should behave. This way of thinking became widespread in Europe in the 1700s
37:34
and 1800s and was an extension of the diminishing of the rights of the monarchy and the church and the
37:41
increasing of the rights of the individual that characterized earlier intellectual movements. New fields like
37:47
economics expanded thanks to thinkers like Adam Smith while figures like John
37:53
Lockach and Montisscu pushed political philosophy in new directions. In particular, the Enlightenment ideas
37:59
of these and other figures promoted rationality and individual liberties and undermined monarchic and religious
38:07
powers, creating a movement toward overthrowing monarchies known as the age of
38:12
revolutions. This wave of revolutions included the American, French, Spanish,
38:17
German, Portuguese, and Italian. As is typical, this era of upheaval led
38:24
some nations to seek out strong leaders who could bring order to the chaos. In
38:29
the case of France, that leader was Napoleon, who changed the course not just of French history, but of European
38:36
history, as he sought to conquer all of Europe. Napoleon was the classic great
38:42
benevolent dictator who converted chaos into order and prosperity and expanded
38:47
the empire with his military prowess. As is often the case, he overreached and
38:55
failed. The Napoleonic Wars and the New World Order that followed 1803 to
39:02
1815. The Napoleonic Wars lasted from 1803 to 1815 when Great Britain and its
39:09
allies defeated Napoleon and his allies. As is usual, the victors got together to
39:15
create a new world order which was hashed out at the Congress of Vienna. It
39:20
drew new boundaries to ensure that no European power would become too dominant based on balance of power concepts that
39:28
would avoid war. The British emerged as the world's leading empire and as is
39:33
typical after the war and the establishment of a new order there was an extended period of peace and
39:39
prosperity the pax bratannica western powers move into Asia
39:48
1800s the British and other western powers brought their gunboats to India
39:53
China and Japan in the mid700s and into the 1800s causing ausing dramatic
39:59
disruptions to the course of their histories. At the time, both China and
40:04
Japan were isolationist. India was controlled by the Mughal Empire, which had expanded
40:10
into a significant power in South Asia, but experienced rapid decline in the
40:15
1700s. The Western powers, which were significantly more advanced militarily at this time, wanted to force trade on
40:23
all three. The Chinese attempted to fight the British, but lost. The
40:28
Japanese saw this and opened themselves for trade after US commander Matthew
40:33
Perry sailed four warships into Tokyo Bay in 1853. These developments led to the
40:40
eventual fall of theQing dynasty, the resignation of the Japanese government, and the continued control of India by
40:47
the British, especially in Japan and China. It also led to the realization that they needed to modernize which
40:54
prompted the Maji restoration in Japan and the self-strengthening movement in China. This move was very successful in
41:02
Japan and not successful in China which continued to suffer in what the Chinese
41:08
call the century of humiliation. Second industrial
41:14
revolution 1850s to early 1900s. Beginning in the mid 1800s, a second big
41:21
wave of innovation took place centered at first around steam powered locomotion, for example, railroads, and
41:28
then electricity, telephones, interchangeable manufacturing parts, and other innovations at the turn of the
41:35
20th century. Whereas the first industrial revolution was centered on the UK, the second industrial revolution
41:42
primarily benefited the United States. As is typical, this period produced both
41:47
great wealth and great wealth gaps and excesses in the capital markets leading
41:52
to an era known as the guilded age in the US. Invention of communism 1848.
42:02
The invention and development of communism in the mid 1800s came as a reaction against both capitalism and the
42:09
wealth gaps it created and the benefits of the industrial revolutions going more to the owners of the new technologies
42:16
than to the workers. Conflicts between communists and the established powers intensified around
42:22
the turn of the century and led to a number of major revolutions in the 20th century, including in both Russia and
42:29
China, where communist governments took power. That brings us to the 20th
42:35
century, which had two big cycles of boom, busts, wars, and new orders. the
42:41
second of which we appear to be in the late stages of. Because I review these comprehensively in chapters 10 through13
42:49
and because they are much more familiar to most listeners, I will end this overview here and dive now into the
42:56
story of the Dutch and how they rose to become the first global reserve currency empire.
Chapter 9: The Big Cycle Rise and Decline of the Dutch Empire and the Guilder
43:04
Chapter nine. The big cycle rise and decline of the Dutch Empire and the
43:11
Gilder. After a series of attempted revolts in the mid 1500s, the Dutch, who
43:16
were under the control of Hapsburg, Spain, finally became powerful enough to gain deacto independence in 1581.
43:24
From 1625 until their collapse in 1795, the Dutch gained enough wealth and power
43:31
to eclipse both the Habsburgs and China as the world's richest empire. The Dutch Empire rose for all
43:39
the classic reasons explained in earlier chapters, peaking around 1650 in what is
43:45
now remembered as the Dutch Golden Age. While its small population and
43:50
territorial footprint prevented it from being the dominant military power on the European continent, it more than made up
43:57
for that through a combination of economic strength, financial sophistication, and a strong navy that
44:04
could protect its large empire of trading posts and colonies around the world. This allowed its currency, the
44:11
Dutch Gilder, to emerge as the first global reserve currency.
44:16
The next PDF chart shows the eight powers that fueled the Dutch ascent and
44:21
eventual decline. What the chart doesn't show is the decline of the prior leading power,
44:27
the Hapsburg Empire, which you can see in the next PDF chart depicting the entire arc of the Dutch Empire with key
44:34
events noted. The numbers mark the approximate times of the six stages of
44:40
the internal order cycle. The story begins with the decline of the
44:45
Spanish Habsburgs which initiated the first stage of the Dutch big
44:51
cycle. The transition from the Spanish Habsburg Empire to the Dutch
44:57
Empire. New empires rise when old ones become weak and decadent. The story of
45:04
the Dutch Empire began when the Habsburg Empire became weak, decadent, and overextended in all the classic ways.
45:11
From 1519 until 1556, the Holy Roman Emperor and head of the Habsburg Empire
45:19
was Charles V. The union of territories he controlled, which included most of
45:25
modern-day Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Spain, made the
45:30
Habsburg Empire the most powerful family empire in Europe. Spain was especially
45:36
strong because of the wealth and power it acquired in the age of exploration.
45:41
By 1500, the territory of modern-day Spain was increasingly unified following
45:47
more than 500 years of conflict between Christian kingdoms and Muslim powers
45:52
that had ruled most of the area since the 700s. The two largest kingdoms,
45:57
Castile and Aragon, were joined together following the marriage of their rulers in 1469. And in 1492, they conquered
46:06
Spain's last Muslim kingdom in Granada. The emergent Spanish power had a strong
46:12
military and very close ties to the Catholic Church. Significant portions of
46:17
the reconista of Muslim Spain took the form of papily supported crusades and
46:23
religious and monarchic authorities were often closely aligned as in the Spanish
46:29
Inquisition. The Spanish fleet was clearly the most powerful navy in Europe. Spanish silver coinage came
46:36
close to being a reserve currency. It was used as far a field as China. Things
46:42
began to change around the mid 1500s as the seeds of decline that were planted
46:47
in the top phase began to germinate and a revolutionary shift in power began to
46:53
brew. This is illustrated in the next several PDF charts. The decline of the Habsburgs
47:01
happened in many of the classic ways. There were revolutions against the elites who held wealth and power by
47:07
those without them, challenging the existing order. For example, as I explained in the previous chapter, new
47:14
religious ideas surfaced in the form of the Reformation, a revolution against the Roman Catholic Church, which was
47:20
perceived as decadent and exploitative. At the time, the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire were a
47:28
rich and powerful political force that was integral to the existing order. The
47:33
revolution started when a collection of religious opposition groups known generally as Protestantism challenged
47:40
the system. Martin Luther published his 95 thesis in 1517 challenging the papal
47:47
interpretation of the Bible and papal power in general. When Luther refused to
47:52
recant, he was declared a heretic and excommunicated. His ideas nonetheless
47:58
took hold in large parts of Europe thanks to the political support of key nobles as well as Europe's new printing
48:04
press technology. This came at an economically difficult time when conflicts were
48:11
intensifying leading to instability and terrible civil wars eventually culminating in the brutal 30 years war
48:18
in the mid600s. For example, the wars of religion in France led to millions of deaths from
48:25
1550 to600, while England violently switched faiths at several points in the
48:31
1500s as new monarchs came to the throne. Even later on, the devastating
48:36
English civil wars of the mid600s were significantly driven by religious
48:43
strife. Its biggest negative impact was on the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburgs.
48:49
Charles V failed to prevent the revolutionary impacts of the reformation and with it the damage to the existing
48:56
order. He was forced to sign the peace of Augsburg in 1555 which weakened the
49:02
Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg dynasty. He abdicated and divided his
49:08
holdings in two. the Holy Roman Empire, which he passed to his brother Ferdinand, and most of the rest of the
49:15
Habsburg Empire, most importantly Spain, but also the Netherlands, Belgium,
49:21
significant portions of Italy, and Spanish colonies abroad, which he passed on to his son Philip II. From that point
49:29
forward, the decline followed the classic script. The empire was overextended militarily. Not only did
49:36
Spain face a lengthy revolt against its unpopular rule in the Netherlands, it also fought with the Ottoman Empire,
49:43
various Italian states, the French and the British. These wars were costly and
49:49
chipped away at the Habsburg family dynasty even before the 30 years war. Terrible national finances caused
49:57
the classic toxic mix of increased taxation, money printing, and rising
50:02
debt. Philip II defaulted on debts four times during his
50:08
reign. The lower and middle classes suffered from rising food prices which
50:13
were increasing at an unprecedented rate from the Spanish price revolution. Internal conflict grew for
50:21
all the previously mentioned reasons. Leadership deteriorated. Philip
50:27
II and his son Philip III preferred lavish living to governing and ultimately used money printing to cover
50:34
the large deficits which led to high inflation and economic pain. Those
50:39
around them behaved similarly. The next PDF chart shows the
50:44
value of the most popular commonly circulating coin in silver terms. Adding
50:50
cheap base metals to the monetary supply was the popular way to print and devalue
50:56
money at the time. You can see it started in the early 1600s. The events of the 1500s were not
51:04
the end of the Habsburg Empire, nor even to its claim to control the Netherlands.
51:09
That wouldn't happen until the end of the 30 Years War in 1648. But they did create the conditions that
51:16
allowed the Dutch to rise. The
51:22
rise. From 1581 until around 1625, the Dutch Empire was built following the
51:29
classic steps of a rising empire outlined in chapter 1. More
51:34
specifically, led by William the Silent, the Dutch successfully revolted against
51:39
Spain in the 80 Years War, which resulted in the Dutch Republic, asserting its independence in
51:46
1581. William, who was basically the father of the Netherlands, was a skilled military commander and united the
51:53
various Dutch provinces against the Spanish. While the Spanish and the Dutch
51:58
continued to fight over the subsequent decades, the Dutch were able to gain independence and the seeds were sewn for
52:05
the rise of a more unified Dutch Republic, particularly as Philip II cut
52:10
off trade with the Dutch, forcing them to expand abroad on their own. Because the republic was set up to
52:17
allow each of the underlying provinces to maintain a high degree of sovereignty, the rise of the Dutch
52:24
Empire was driven by a collective of statesmen rather than by a single monarch or leader. Though nobles held
52:31
the most important roles, this system created checks and balances and a partnership that proved
52:38
effective. Dutch values and culture emphasized education, saving, merit, and
52:44
tolerance. The break from Spain allowed the Dutch to create a more open and inventive
52:51
society. The Dutch invented ships that could go around the world to collect riches, capitalism that could finance
52:59
these and other productive endeavors, and many more breakthroughs that made them rich and powerful. The Dutch
53:05
created the world's first mega corporation, the Dutch East India Company, which accounted for about 1/3
53:12
of world trade. rough estimate based on my calculations. Dutch openness to new
53:18
ideas, people, and technology helped them rise quickly. To support trade, the Dutch
53:25
government increased military investments, which allowed the country to control still more trade by holding
53:31
off the British in a number of military conflicts. The Dutch also created the world's first
53:37
reserve currency other than gold and silver, the Dutch Gilder, supported by an innovative banking and currency
53:44
system put into place via the establishment of the Bank of Amsterdam.
53:49
In this chapter, when talking about the gilder, we are generally referring to gilder banknotes which were used at the
53:56
bank of Amsterdam rather than to the physical coin also called gilder which was made of a precious metal that is
54:03
type one money. As a result of these classic and sound fundamental steps, the Dutch
54:11
became rich. Income per capita in the Netherlands rose to over twice that of most other European powers. The Dutch
54:18
continued to invest heavily in education and infrastructure to build on their successes. Dutch literacy rates reached
54:25
twice the world average. They continued to help their capital markets and Amsterdam became the world's most
54:31
important financial center. The Dutch did all of this with a population of only 1 to 2 million people.
54:40
The next PDF charts provide some perspective on the unique nature of Dutch education, innovation, and trade
54:47
in the 1600s and the impact these forces had on Dutch incomes, all of which we
54:53
will explore later in this chapter. In short, the Dutch were superbly educated people who were very
55:00
hardworking and inventive. In fact, they came up with about a quarter of all
55:05
major inventions in the world when they were at their peak. a spike that began shortly before Dutch independence from
55:13
Spain. To reiterate, the two most important inventions they came up with were one, uniquely effective sailing
55:21
ships that could take them all around the world, which with the military skills they acquired from the fighting
55:27
they did in Europe, allowed them to collect great riches, and two, the capitalism that fueled these endeavors.
55:36
The capital markets cycle of the Dutch. The Dutch invented capitalism as
55:42
we know it. This was great for the Dutch and great for the world. But like most
55:47
great inventions, it brought with it some potentially deadly consequences. While production, trade, and private
55:54
ownership had existed before, the ability of large numbers of people to collectively buy ownership in
56:01
money-making endeavors through public equity markets did not exist. The Dutch
56:06
created that when they invented the world's first publicly listed company, the Dutch East India Company, and the
56:13
first stock exchange in6002. Like most inventions, these capital
56:18
market developments arose out of necessity and self-interest. The voyages across the world in search of new trade
56:25
routes were risky ventures, so it made sense for merchants to sell some of the risk associated with the voyage to
56:32
others in exchange for a share of the future profits. At the time the Dutch introduced equity shares in their
56:38
voyages in the mid 1500s, it was revolutionary. Until 1600, these shares
56:44
were held by only a small number of merchants, largely lacked transparency, and were illquid. So, their
56:51
attractiveness to outside investors was limited. The formation of the Amsterdam
56:56
Stock Exchange in August602 and the listing of the Dutch East India Company spread share
57:02
ownership much wider. More than 1 in 50 Dutch adults owned shares, and the
57:08
exchange's clear rules about ownership and transfer of shares made the market much more
57:14
transparent. The Dutch East India Company was an equally revolutionary invention. The world's first
57:20
transnational corporation, it had many of the features you see in companies today. Shareholders, a corporate logo, a
57:28
board of directors, etc. Capital markets enabled investors to save, merchants to
57:33
raise funds, and everyone to have a liquid market in which transfers of capital could happen easily and
57:40
efficiently, fueling a new era of wealth accumulation. At their peak in the early
57:46
1700s, Dutch East India Company dividends accounted for nearly $1 out of every $100 of total Dutch GDP.
57:55
Importantly, the Dutch out competed the Spanish and the Portuguese, which led them to win the main prize, a higher
58:02
share of the trading between Europe and Asia, particularly China and Indonesia,
58:07
which was very profitable. This is illustrated in the next PDF chart titled
58:13
Dutch East India Company Dividends. In addition to creating an equity
58:18
market, the Dutch developed an innovative banking system which grew rapidly and began to finance
58:24
international trade for Dutch and non-Dutch merchants. Prior to the Dutch
58:29
banking innovations, the international currency situation was a mess. In the
58:34
late 1500s, around 800 different foreign and domestic coins circulated in the Netherlands, many of which were debased,
58:42
that is, had a lowered content of precious metal in the coins, and difficult to distinguish from
58:48
counterfeits. This created uncertainty over the value of money, which made international trade slower and more
58:55
expensive. In6009, the Bank of Amsterdam was established as an exchange bank to
59:01
protect commercial creditors from unreliable commodity money in general circulation. The Bank of Amsterdam
59:08
undertook activities that would generate monetary stability and put the Netherlands coinage, the bank's letters
59:15
of credit, and the Dutch financial system at the center of global finance.
59:20
Notably, this bank gilder, though backed by hard currency, was essentially type 2
59:26
money. That set up the gilder as a true reserve currency, the first of its kind.
59:33
Please see the next PDF graph titled grams of fine silver per
59:38
gilder. As a result of this system, the gilder remained effective as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of
59:45
wealth. Bank of Amsterdam bills of exchange improved their status as a reserve currency. Baltic and Russian
59:53
trade relied solely on gilders and Bank of Amsterdam bills of exchange for pricing and contract settlement. By
1:00:01
1650, it was fairly common for say a merchant in London to pay for goods imported from Moscow with a bill drawn
1:00:08
on their deposit in Amsterdam. Both the number of accounts and deposit base of the bank rose continually through
1:00:18
1650. The new world order, the 30 years war and the peace of West
1:00:24
Falia. Then came the 30 Years War 1618 to 1648.
1:00:30
While the Dutch played a relatively minor role in the Europewide conflict, it is worth covering this war in some
1:00:37
detail given its importance to the internal and external orders of Europe more broadly. It is also a classic case
1:00:44
of how internal and external orders work together. All the classic balance of
1:00:51
power dynamics came into play. In this case, the 30 Years War was a classic
1:00:56
fight over wealth and power, just a lot longer one. On one side was the Catholic
1:01:02
emperor of Habsburg, Austria, who was allied with the German Catholic territories, most prominently Bavaria,
1:01:09
as well as with Spain and the Papal States. On the other side were the German Protestant nobles, allied at
1:01:16
different points in time with Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France. The
1:01:22
fighting was about money, religion, Protestants versus Catholics, and
1:01:27
geopolitics. The alliances were pretty complex. For example, the French monarchy, despite being Catholic and
1:01:34
having Cardinal Rishel Yu driving policy, was allied first secretly, then
1:01:39
openly with both Lutheran Sweden and largely Calvinist Netherlands. That is
1:01:45
because money and geopolitics mattered more than religious ideologies.
1:01:51
Cardinal Rishelu was the most important leader in France at the time, serving as chief minister from 1624 until
1:01:59
1642. Rishelu was a brilliant man who provided advice to the two rivals for
1:02:05
control of the monarchy in France. The queen mother and her young son Louis the
1:02:10
13th. You can't make this stuff up. Rishela had his own particular view of
1:02:16
how an internal order should work which was that the state should be all powerful more important than what the
1:02:23
monarchy church or nobility wanted. Besides being a great big picture
1:02:28
thinker he was a great administrator who made the system work well. He improved
1:02:33
efficiency throughout the kingdom effectively collecting taxes and controlling power over the nobility and
1:02:39
local authorities. He created the notions of national interest and balance of power. For example, focusing policy
1:02:47
on the goal of having France balance the Habsburg hegemony. This wasn't that long after
1:02:53
Mchaveli's theories first circulated. His concept of keeping central Europe
1:02:58
divided and balanced because united it would dominate other areas worked from
1:03:04
1624 until the French Revolution. For more, see Henry Kissinger's World Order.
1:03:11
The Habsburgs lost the war that left them in a meaningfully weakened position. The treaty that established
1:03:18
the new international order, the peace of Westfailia expanded the autonomy of the individual princes of the Holy Roman
1:03:26
Empire, further eroding the limited authority of the Austrian Emperor over the other states. More importantly, the
1:03:33
deal that was cut at Westfailia invented countries as we know them. Which is to say, it allowed sovereignty of the state
1:03:41
with the ability to make choices within its geographic borders. For example, their religions, their languages, and
1:03:47
all their rules, and instituted respect for those boundaries so that no longer would borderless, free flowing power
1:03:54
grabs occur without, of course, the understanding that you'd be starting a major war. The emergence of the concept
1:04:01
of states led to nationalism and the pursuit of national interests which reshaped the concept of the balance of
1:04:08
power between rival states. It also made the religious authorities much less
1:04:15
powerful. The peace of West Failia reflected what I call the exhaustion of war which contributed to a long period
1:04:22
of peace and prosperity that followed. Like all big wars, the 30 Years War
1:04:28
produced devastating losses of life, property, and wealth. One quarter of the
1:04:33
population of Europe died from combat, disease, or starvation. Because wars are so much
1:04:40
more terrible than even those who are eager for them can imagine, they lead to treaties that redefine the order and are
1:04:47
followed by periods of peace until the next big war happens.
1:04:52
The Dutch benefited greatly from the new balance of power and period of relative
1:04:57
stability. Probably most importantly, it protected them from the threat of Habsburg
1:05:03
domination. It is also the case that wars are devastating financially. That
1:05:09
is true for the winners and much more so for the losers. For example, France, though a winner and
1:05:16
only indirectly involved for much of the war, experienced such bad financial
1:05:22
problems and instability as a result that it was faced with widespread rebellions. The losing Habsburg Empire
1:05:29
was even more devastated relative to the French and Spanish. The Dutch were less financially hurt. They benefited from
1:05:36
the peace that fostered the Dutch Golden Age. The Dutch also benefited from the military developments that occurred in
1:05:43
the war because when coupled with the shipping capabilities of the Dutch East India Company, this strong shipping and
1:05:50
military combination expanded Dutch power around the
1:05:56
world. The top the Dutch golden age led the Dutch
1:06:02
to shift their attentions to living the good life in a way that weakened their finances. Other powers rose too and
1:06:09
began to challenge them. The arrival of capitalism combined with the new approaches of the enlightenment led to
1:06:16
an economic transformation called the industrial revolution which was centered in Britain. The Dutch who had been the
1:06:24
unparalleled leaders in innovation, trade, and wealth in the 1600s failed to
1:06:29
keep up. Eventually, the cost of maintaining a declining and overextended empire became unsustainable.
1:06:37
The next PDF chart titled Dutch standing relative to other great powers shows a
1:06:43
number of key steps. At the top, the Dutch saw a reversal of many of the classic
1:06:49
ingredients we discussed earlier. The Dutch educational and technological edge
1:06:55
eroded. The Dutch became uncompetitive in general and via the decline of the
1:07:00
Dutch East India Company. In the 1700s, the industrial revolution led the British to overtake
1:07:07
the Dutch as the preeminent economic and financial power in Europe. Slower
1:07:12
economic growth relative to other powers made it more difficult to pay for and maintain its vast empire, especially one
1:07:20
controlled by such a small nation. Increasing military conflicts and attempts to protect their vast wealth
1:07:27
around the world, left the Dutch overextended and overenddebted.
1:07:32
This all set the stage for the decline of the Gilders's reserve currency status which ultimately deteriorated after the
1:07:39
Dutch lost a war and with it important assets to the British. With the Dutch Empire weakened,
1:07:46
its financial center eroded, especially after a series of debt crises and a run
1:07:51
on the central bank and currency. Even though the peace of West Failia
1:07:57
brought relative peace and stability to Europe, the Dutch were still engaged in a number of conflicts throughout their
1:08:04
time as an empire as opponents saw their weaknesses and attacked, especially via
1:08:09
naval wars fought over trade. Here is a brief summary of the wars the Dutch fought to build and then
1:08:16
to hold on to its empire. 80 Years War 1566 to 1648.
1:08:24
This was the revolt by Protestant Netherlands against Catholic Spain. The
1:08:29
Dutch first declared independence in 1581, but their full independence was not realized until the peace of
1:08:36
Westfailia 1648 ended both the 30 Years War and the 80 Years
1:08:42
War. The first Anglo Dutch War 1652 to 1654.
1:08:48
This was a trade war that began when the English Parliament passed the Navigation Act of
1:08:54
1651, mandating that all goods from its American colonies be carried by English
1:08:59
ships. The war was largely a stalemate and failed to resolve the trade rivalry
1:09:04
between the nations. The Deno Swedish war 1657 to
1:09:10
1660. This began when Sweden declared war on Denmark, a Dutch ally, threatening the
1:09:17
highly profitable Baltic trade routes. The Dutch defeated the Swedish. The second Anglo Dutch War 1665
1:09:26
to 1667. England and the Netherlands fought over another trade dispute which ended
1:09:32
with a Dutch victory. the Franco Dutch War
1:09:37
1672-78 and the third Anglo Dutch War 1672-74. These were also fights over
1:09:45
trade. The Dutch foiled French plans to conquer the Netherlands and forced them to reduce some of their tariffs but at a
1:09:52
tremendous cost. The fourth Anglo Dutch War 1780
1:09:58
to84. The British began the war in retaliation for Dutch support of the colonies in the American Revolution. It
1:10:06
ended in a significant defeat for the Dutch, ushering in the end of the Gilder as a reserve currency.
1:10:14
Ironically, it was a military victory, one that began nearly a century of peace
1:10:19
that led power to shift away from the Netherlands. In 1688, William III of
1:10:25
Orange married Mary II, who was the daughter of the unpopular king of England and successfully invaded England
1:10:32
and took power. This was known as the Glorious Revolution and created a new
1:10:37
internal order for Great Britain. While it was undoubtedly good for the Dutch in
1:10:42
the short run to have William III on the British throne, the second order consequences of economic integration and
1:10:50
military cooperation played a major role in the decline of Dutch economic power
1:10:56
and the Guilder over the next century. After 1688, as Great Britain
1:11:02
became more competitive, Dutch merchants shifted their operations to London, hastening its rise as an international
1:11:09
center of finance. The alliance also gave English merchants access to Dutch
1:11:15
trade. William III moved to England instead of focusing his attention on ruling the Netherlands. When he died
1:11:22
heless in 1702, the direct connection between the two nations was broken and
1:11:27
the various Dutch provinces that had been unified under him began to splinter. While England and the
1:11:34
Netherlands continued to have military partnerships against the French during most of the 80 plus years leading up to
1:11:40
the fourth Anglo Dutch War, by the mid700s they were beginning to bump into
1:11:46
each other in many of the same markets. By the mid- 18th century, the
1:11:51
Dutch Empire was no longer the world's leading empire. Britain especially had
1:11:56
learned from Dutch innovations and made their own investments in education to strengthen their people's capabilities.
1:12:03
These abilities, coupled with the use of capitalism, led to the advancements that made up the industrial revolution, which
1:12:10
brought about constant improvements on existing concepts to make production more efficient, such as standardizing
1:12:17
inputs and moving production from individual artisans to factories. It
1:12:23
also led to transformative new inventions. This allowed the British to become more productive, capture more
1:12:29
trade, and build military might. Additionally, and as is classic, as the
1:12:36
Dutch became extremely wealthy, they became less competitive. For example,
1:12:41
their wages were generally higher than those in other parts of Europe. The Dutch East India Company lost its
1:12:47
competitive edge as well. For example, it was ineffective in trading popular new products like tea. Dutch economic
1:12:55
growth slowed relative to other powers, which made it more difficult for the Dutch to pay for and maintain their vast
1:13:03
empire. Increasing military conflicts to protect their vast wealth left them
1:13:09
overextended. Thus, from around 1725 through around 1800, the financial
1:13:14
decline unfolded in the classic ways. The next two PDF charts do a good job of
1:13:21
conveying both the ascent and the decline of the Bank of Amsterdam. As is classic, the reserve
1:13:29
currency status of the Guilder remained strong even as the Netherlands other powers began to decline. Because bills
1:13:36
of exchange were the dominant vehicle for international trade credit, all merchants wishing to trade with the
1:13:43
Dutch were forced to open an account at the Bank of Amsterdam, which led to around 40% of global trade being settled
1:13:50
in Amsterdam using bank gilders. the importance of the Dutch in trade and
1:13:56
financial transactions, the Bank of Amsterdam's policies that made the Gilder very effective as both a medium
1:14:02
of exchange and a storehold of wealth, and the fact that Dutch commercial entities and banks insisted on its
1:14:09
usage, all cemented the Guilder's place as the first global reserve
1:14:15
currency. Available payment data supports the claim that the Guilder accounted for a large share of global
1:14:21
trade. The annual value of payments made through the bank peaked in the 1760s at
1:14:27
about 1 and a half times the Dutch Republic's annual GDP, with some estimates more than double that. Similar
1:14:35
ratios for the United Kingdom in 1868 and the United States in 1955 were 3.6
1:14:42
and 2.7, respectively. This gave the Dutch the extraordinary privilege of being able to
1:14:49
get into a lot of debt. [Music] the
1:14:55
decline. Around 1750, the British and the French became stronger than the
1:15:00
Dutch, both because their own power had grown and because the Dutch had become weaker. As is classic, the Dutch A
1:15:08
became more indebted, B experienced a lot of internal fighting over wealth,
1:15:14
and C weakened militarily. A good example of this is the popularity
1:15:19
of the patriot movement in the Netherlands around this time. All this made them vulnerable to decline and
1:15:26
attack. As earnings from abroad fell, wealthy Dutch savers moved their cash
1:15:32
into British investments which were more attractive due to their strong growth and higher yields. There was a general
1:15:38
rise in foreign investment by the Dutch during this period. Examples include Dutch purchases of stock in the British
1:15:45
East India Company and the city of London selling term annuities bonds to Dutch investors. For further
1:15:52
description, see Hart, Joner and Vanzaden, a financial history of the Netherlands. Despite this, the Gilder
1:15:59
remained widely used as a global reserve currency. As explained earlier, reserve
1:16:04
currency status classically lags the decline of other key drivers of the rise and fall of empires. Then, as is
1:16:12
typical, a rising great power challenged the existing great power in a war.
1:16:17
Starting in the 1770s, the English began to interfere with Dutch shipping, escalating the conflict after the Dutch
1:16:24
traded arms with the colonies during the American Revolution. In retaliation, the
1:16:30
English delivered a massive blow to the Dutch Navy in the Caribbean in 1781, taking over Dutch territories
1:16:37
there and in the East Indies as well. Having lost half its ships and access to
1:16:42
its key trade routes, the Dutch East India Company had to borrow heavily from the Bank of Amsterdam to stay alive.
1:16:49
Rival powers took the Dutch defeat as an opportunity to grab still more of the Dutch shipping business. British
1:16:56
blockades in the Netherlands and the East Indies caused a liquidity crisis. The financial consequences of these
1:17:03
events can be seen in the next PDF charts. The first PDF chart only shows
1:17:08
the financial results from the Dutch East India Company reported in Patria that is the Netherlands. It does not
1:17:16
include the parts of the revenue and debt from its operations in Asia, but does include its revenue from goods it
1:17:22
sourced in Asia and sold in Europe. Financial losses and large debts
1:17:27
led to the classic move by the central bank to print more money. As the Bank of
1:17:32
Amsterdam printed more and more paper money to provide loans to the Dutch East India Company, it soon became clear that
1:17:40
there would not be enough gold and silver to cover all the paper claims on it. That led to the classic run-onthe
1:17:46
dynamic in which investors exchanged their paper money for precious metals.
1:17:52
With the bank's store of precious metals exhausted, the supply of gilders soared,
1:17:57
even as demand for them fell, as shown in the next PDF chart, Bank of Amsterdam
1:18:02
holdings, percentage of GDP. The next PDF chart titled Bank of
1:18:08
Amsterdam loans outstanding shows this explosion of loans on the bank's balance
1:18:13
sheet throughout the fourth Anglo Dutch War. For reference, the full balance sheet at
1:18:19
the start of the war was about 20 million bank gilders outstanding. So this represented a roughly 50% expansion
1:18:26
in the Bank of Amsterdam's balance sheet. The Bank of Amsterdam had no choice. The Dutch East India Company was
1:18:33
too big to fail because the government depended on loans from the company. Interest rates rose and the
1:18:40
Bank of Amsterdam had to devalue, undermining the credibility of the Guilder as a storehold of wealth.
1:18:46
The Bank of Amsterdam was ahead of its time and used ledgers instead of real paper money. See Quinn and Roberts, the
1:18:54
Bank of Amsterdam through the lens of monetary competition. As a result, the British
1:19:00
pound replaced the Dutch Gilder as the leading reserve currency.
1:19:05
What happened to the Dutch was classic, as described in chapter 1's summary of why empires rise and fall, and chapter
1:19:13
3's description of how money, credit, and debt work. The Bank of Amsterdam
1:19:18
started with a type one monetary system, precious metal, that morphed into a type
1:19:23
two monetary system, paper money, linked to precious metal. As usual, this
1:19:28
transition occurred at a time of financial stress and military conflict. It was risky because the transition
1:19:35
decreased trust in the currency and added to the risk of a bankr run-like dynamic which is exactly what occurred.
1:19:43
The Bank of Amsterdam deposits that is holdings of short-term debt had been a reliable storehold of wealth for nearly
1:19:50
two centuries. They began to trade at large discounts to gilder coins which were made of gold and silver. The bank
1:19:57
used its holdings of coin and precious metals, that is its reserves, to buy its
1:20:02
currency on the open market to support the value of deposits. But it lacked adequate foreign currency reserves to do
1:20:09
this indefinitely. Accounts backed by coins held at the bank plummeted from 17
1:20:15
million gilder in March 1780 to only 300,000 gilder in January 1783. as
1:20:22
owners of these gold and silver coins demanded them back. The bank run marked
1:20:27
the end of the Dutch Empire and the Gilder as a reserve currency. In 1791,
1:20:33
the bank was taken over by the city of Amsterdam. And in 1795, the French
1:20:38
Revolutionary Government overthrew the Dutch Republic, establishing a client state in its place. After being
1:20:45
nationalized in 1796, rendering its stock worthless, the Dutch East India
1:20:50
Company's charter expired in 1799. The next PDF charts show the
1:20:57
exchange rates between the Guilder and the Pound and gold. As it became clear
1:21:02
that the bank no longer had any credibility, investors fled to other assets and currencies. Historical data
1:21:09
suggests that by 1795, bank deposits were trading at a - 255% discount to
1:21:16
actual coin. See Quinn and Roberts, death of a reserve
1:21:22
currency. To fully represent the likely economics of a deposit holder at the
1:21:27
Bank of Amsterdam, we assumed depositors each received their pro-rated share of
1:21:32
precious metal still in the bank's vaults when it closed. That was roughly 20% of the fully backed amount. Thus,
1:21:39
the approximately 80% total devaluation. The following PDF chart
1:21:45
shows the returns of holding Dutch East India Company stock starting in various years. As with most bubble companies, it
1:21:52
did great at first and seemed to have great fundamentals. This attracted still more investors even after those
1:21:59
fundamentals began to weaken. Ultimately, its failed fundamentals and excessive debt burdens broke
1:22:06
it. As is typical, the returns of investment assets in the declining empire fall relative to the returns of
1:22:14
investing in the rising empire. Returns on investment in the British East India
1:22:19
Company, for example, far exceeded those in the Dutch East India Company. And the returns on Dutch government bonds were
1:22:25
terrible relative to British government bonds, as shown in the next PDF charts.
1:22:31
The decline of the Dutch Empire led to the next big cycle in world history, the
1:22:37
rise and decline of the British Empire and its reserve currency. That story,
1:22:42
which is basically the same story just a century or so later in a more technologically evolved form with people
1:22:50
in different clothes speaking a different language is told in the next
1:22:55
chapter. Chapter 10. The big cycle rise and decline of the British Empire and
Chapter 10: The Big Cycle Rise and Decline of the British Empire and the Pound
1:23:02
the pound. Changes in the world order come about when two or more countries or
1:23:08
alliances of countries of comparable power fight and one wins and becomes
1:23:14
dominant enough to set the new rules which is the new world order. Before
1:23:19
this happens, the rising country needs to get itself into a comparable position of strength relative to the reigning
1:23:25
country. So the story of any great country's rise begins long before it becomes a great power. Likewise, the
1:23:33
story of its decline extends long after it ceases to be a great power. That is
1:23:38
reflected in the arc chart that shows the simplified version of the cycles of the Dutch, British, American, and
1:23:45
Chinese empires that I shared with you before. The rise of the British Empire started
1:23:51
long before it became preeminent as it first had to build its educational,
1:23:56
institutional, and technological strengths to become more competitive and then challenge and defeat the
1:24:02
Dutch. This next PDF chart shows my gauges of the eight measures of power
1:24:08
for the British Empire from 1600 to the present. As shown, competitiveness,
1:24:13
education, and innovation, and technology levels rose sharply in the early 1600s and continued to increase
1:24:20
steadily from 1600 to 1800, which paid off from 1700 to 1900 as the UK's
1:24:27
output, share of world trade, and military expanded together. With the
1:24:33
typical lag, the development of Britain's financial markets and its financial center London to become world
1:24:39
leaders followed and with a greater lag, the pound overtook the gilder as the
1:24:45
global reserve currency. Please see the next PDF chart titled United Kingdom index of key
1:24:52
determinance. While the fall of the Dutch in the late 1700s removed the UK's primary trade and
1:24:59
financial competitor, Britain's rise wasn't complete until the early 1800s
1:25:05
because it had one last great rival power to defeat, France, led by
1:25:10
Napoleon. You see, Napoleon was on a tear to conquer Europe and be the greatest power via the Napoleonic Wars.
1:25:19
This created the usual sort of great power rivalry and balance of power struggle dynamic that I described in the
1:25:26
addendum to chapter 2 with all the alliances and escalation building to a great
1:25:32
crescendo. Later in this chapter, I will briefly drop into the French story, also
1:25:37
an iconic one, as part of explaining the rise of the British Empire. But for now
1:25:42
I will simply jump to the punchline which is that Britain won through effective economic as well as military
1:25:50
warfare. Then following the classic big cycle script of what happens after wars
1:25:55
that establish the dominant power there was a new world order set out by the winners followed by a long period in
1:26:03
this case 100 years of relative peace and prosperity. That is when the British
1:26:08
Empire became the greatest empire ever. At its peak, with only 2.5% of the
1:26:15
world's population in the UK, the British Empire produced over 20% of the
1:26:20
world's income and controlled over 20% of the world's land mass and over 25% of
1:26:27
the global population. But I'm getting ahead of myself. As shown in the previous PDF
1:26:34
chart, the story of Britain's rise began around 1600. So, we should start there.
1:26:40
The following PDF chart shows the arc and the timing of key events. The
1:26:45
numbers mark the approximate times of the six stages of the internal order
1:26:53
cycle. The rise. To set the stage for the UK's rise, we
1:26:59
need to describe its situation as well as the broader backdrop of Europe at the end of the
1:27:05
1600s. For both, the early 17th century had massive conflicts that radically
1:27:11
changed or overturned all the prior orders. As explained in the last chapter, in Europe, there was great
1:27:18
devastation and change that resulted from the 30 years war because it was a war between ideologies, religions, and
1:27:25
economic classes that created a new European order through the peace of Westfailia. This treaty established
1:27:32
countries as we know them and created a fractured Europe which led to different choices in different countries. Great
1:27:39
Britain had its own turmoil over wealth and power that took the forms of the English Civil War, which was a brutally
1:27:46
violent continuation of the centuries long battles between classes and the glorious revolution, which less
1:27:53
violently led to William III, a Dutch ruler, becoming the king of England.
1:27:58
What these conflicts have in common is that they weakened the monarchy and strengthened Parliament. They also
1:28:05
established terms for the relationships between the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The English Civil
1:28:12
War specifically led to the King Charles I being tried and executed and the
1:28:18
monarchy being replaced by the Commonwealth of England under the rule of the general who led the revolt,
1:28:24
Oliver Cromwell. These conflicts established rule of law rather than rule of the monarchy and
1:28:32
they created a new balance of power between the king and parliament that set the foundation for Great Britain's later
1:28:38
rise. That is because a strong parliament allowed for a moderately meritocratic selection of national
1:28:44
leaders as the prime minister had to command the confidence of parliament rather than just be a favorite of the
1:28:50
royal court. Statesmen who led Britain during its later rise and peak such as
1:28:56
William Pit the Elder and his son Willpit the Younger, Robert Peele, William Gladstone and Benjamin Dizraeli
1:29:04
were strong forces for shaping Britain. They all came from families of
1:29:09
merchants, not the landed gentry. This revolutionary strengthening of
1:29:15
parliament was heavily influenced by the new enlightenment thinking about who should have what powers and how
1:29:21
governments should work that had spread throughout Europe starting in the late 1600s. That was shaped by the earlier
1:29:28
scientific thought of Englishman Francis Bacon 1561 to 1626.
1:29:34
At the core of this new human- ccentric philosophy was the idea that society
1:29:39
should be based on reason and science and that the government's power comes from the people not from
1:29:46
God. Debate and skepticism were encouraged. Improvements in basic education which caused literacy rates to
1:29:53
rise. The dissemination of ideas via printed materials. The first encyclopedias and dictionaries were
1:30:00
printed on mass at this time. and a growing number of transnational elites who were well read and cultivated
1:30:07
crossber contacts created a new and wider public sphere of political and
1:30:12
social thought. The key thinkers during this time produced ideas and concepts that are still important in the western
1:30:19
world. Enlightenment ideas influence different countries in different ways, ranging
1:30:25
from more autocratic monarchs like Katherine the Great and Russia to the more representative form of government
1:30:31
adopted by America's founding fathers. The UK particularly reaped the
1:30:37
benefits of the Enlightenment's strong political institutions and rule of law alongside the Enlightenment's emphasis
1:30:43
on science which supported major discoveries. While these strengths did not bring
1:30:49
about immediate prosperity over time, the British systems respect for the rule of law combined with strong education
1:30:57
gave it the foundation to gain competitive advantages in commerce and innovations that followed and led to the
1:31:03
rise of the British Empire. At the same time, England became financially strong as it created a
1:31:10
powerful and centralized fiscal authority that allowed the state to raise significantly more revenue than
1:31:16
its international rivals. By the 18th century, the tax burden in Britain was
1:31:21
almost twice that of France. The creation of the Bank of England in 1694
1:31:26
helped standardize and increase the liquidity of UK government debt, improving its ability to borrow.
1:31:34
Consistent with these reforms, government bond yields fell drastically, both outright and relative to other
1:31:41
countries over the early 1700s. Please see the next PDF
1:31:47
charts. By the early 1700s, there were many other classic signs of an empire on
1:31:52
the rise. In the next charts, you can see Britain's leadership and innovation compared to its main rivals at the time.
1:32:02
The industrial revolution, a welleducated population
1:32:07
together with a culture of inventiveness and the availability of capital to financially support the developments of
1:32:14
new ideas, especially about how machines could more efficiently do what many were
1:32:19
laboring to do, created a great wave of competitiveness and prosperity.
1:32:25
England's geological endowments of iron and coal gave it a great boost in
1:32:30
producing this economic transformation known as the first industrial revolution. As described in chapter 8,
1:32:37
this shift changed Europe from a primarily rural and agrarian society in which most people were poor and power
1:32:45
resided with landowning elites to an urban and industrial society in which
1:32:50
people as a whole got a lot richer. Though benefits disproportionately accred to the elites and power resided
1:32:58
with central government bureaucrats and capitalists. Geopolitically these
1:33:03
strengths led it to overtake the Dutch as the preeminent economic and financial power in Europe around
1:33:10
1750 years before the UK defeated the Dutch in the battle and clearly became
1:33:15
the world's leading empire. The productivity revolution started with agriculture. Agricultural
1:33:22
inventions increased productivity which reduced the labor intensity of farming. It also made food more plentiful and
1:33:29
cheaper which led to a population boom. Together these forces led to people
1:33:35
flocking to cities which benefited industry from the steadily increasing supply of labor. The industrial
1:33:42
revolution was driven not only by the creation of brand new inventions like the steam engine, but also by adapting
1:33:49
and improving on existing concepts to make production more efficient, such as standardizing inputs and moving
1:33:56
production from individual artisans to factories. Ample labor, energy, and
1:34:02
connected global markets together helped support the burst of innovation.
1:34:07
This list gives a sense of the timing and pace of innovation in the
1:34:13
UK. 1712 steam engine invented. 1719 silk factory
1:34:21
established. 1733 flying shuttle basic weaving machine
1:34:27
invented. 1764 spinning jenny multi-pindle weaving
1:34:32
machine invented. 1765 separate condenser for steam
1:34:38
engines invented. 1769 water frame hydraulic
1:34:43
power for weaving machines invented steam engine upgraded.
1:34:48
1785 power loom invented iron refining developed. 1801 steam powered locomotive
1:34:56
on wheels invented. 1816 steam-powered locomotive on rail
1:35:03
patented. 1825 railway construction initiated on a line connecting
1:35:09
Manchester and Liverpool. Through these revolutionary changes to agriculture and industry,
1:35:16
Europe became urban and industrial with goods made by machines in city factories.
1:35:22
The new urban population required new types of goods and services, which required the government to get bigger
1:35:29
and spend money on things like housing, sanitation, and education, as well as to
1:35:34
set up the infrastructure for the new industrial capitalist system to flourish, such as courts, regulators,
1:35:40
and central banks. Power was in the hands of central government bureaucrats and capitalists who controlled the means
1:35:47
of production. This was most true in the United Kingdom, which pioneered many of the
1:35:53
most important innovations and which used the new methods of production to pull ahead of other nations and become
1:36:00
the world's leading superpower. As reflected in output per capita, the UK's living standards caught
1:36:07
up to those in the Netherlands by around 1800 and overtook them in the mid-9th
1:36:12
century when the UK approached the zenith of its share of world output, around 20%.
1:36:19
In parallel to this economic growth and helping to reinforce it, the UK became
1:36:24
the world's dominant trading nation, pulling decisively ahead of the Dutch in the late 1700s and maintaining that
1:36:31
position through the 19th century. At the same time, there was an acceleration
1:36:36
in the output of all countries through most of the 1800s. Most countries in the world were
1:36:42
then in stages three and four of the internal order cycle. Please see the next PDF
1:36:49
chart. Naturally, as it became a world economic power, the UK needed to be able
1:36:55
to fight militarily to both protect and assert its interests. The UK's military
1:37:01
strength, especially its navy, helped it establish its colonies and take over those of other European powers, as well
1:37:09
as secure its control over global trade routes. The profitability of the empire more
1:37:15
than paid for its military spending because it supported economic activities. Thanks to the Bank of
1:37:21
England's financial innovations and the Guilders collapse, London became the world's financial center and the pound
1:37:28
sterling was the world's reserve currency. In other words, Great Britain
1:37:33
followed the classic big cycle steps of a rising empire.
1:37:38
Britain also took the Netherlands mantle as the top trader with China. With the
1:37:44
industrial revolution, Europe no longer demanded nearly as much in the way of manufactured luxury goods from China,
1:37:50
but instead sought a commodity, tea. China for its part wasn't interested in
1:37:57
European goods and continued to seek payment in precious metals. That sewed
1:38:02
the seeds of the great British Chinese conflict that led to the opium wars and China's century of
1:38:09
humiliation. Who would have imagined that? The story of Britain's rise is
1:38:15
obvious in retrospect. It's easy to look back and describe what happened. It's another thing to position oneself well
1:38:22
for it by anticipating it and seeing it happen at the time. I wonder what I
1:38:27
would have thought at the time. I wonder whether in looking at the readings of my indicators and systems and thinking
1:38:34
about the situations whether I would have bet well. That is why it is so
1:38:39
important to me to have the data and the decision rules to see what I would have actually done and what the results would
1:38:45
have been. I can now see what the indicators would have shown at the time and know that
1:38:51
they would have painted the picture I just described. And I can see from that that the picture would not have been
1:38:57
crystal clear that the British Empire would have gone on to become the dominant world empire. If I were alive
1:39:03
in the early 1700s and looking at my indicators, I would have seen the Dutch still at their peak and Bourban France
1:39:10
as a major power on the rise also. and I would have seen bullish conditions for them both at that
1:39:18
time. Why not the French? In the early 1700s, France was a
1:39:25
center of education and learning, a hub of the enlightenment with famous thinkers like Voltater and Montescu and
1:39:31
a home to a booming publishing industry. So my indicators would have shown the French as being just as strong as the
1:39:38
Dutch and British powers. From 1720 to 1780, the number of books on the arts
1:39:45
and science published in Paris doubled. As the quantity of information increased, so did people's literacy.
1:39:52
Over the course of the 18th century, literacy rates in France close to doubled. Please see the next PDF
1:40:00
charts. France also would have shown up as economically strong in the early
1:40:05
stage of a big debt cycle upswing. It was just before an investment boom was
1:40:10
about to turn into a bubble, which later turned into a bust. At the time, France's most famous economist was John
1:40:18
Law, a Scotsman by birth, who thought the creation of new money would stimulate the economy. In 1716, he
1:40:26
created a national bank with the ability to issue paper money backed by land,
1:40:31
gold, silver, and state bills. That began the upswing in the cycle. The
1:40:37
original capital for this bank general was provided by shareholders who also
1:40:43
sat on the bank's board. France had had a stock market since 1673 when finance
1:40:49
minister Jean Baptiste Cobber's ordinance of trade was codified into commercial law. This law created
1:40:57
monopolistic joint stock companies to trade in both the East and West Indies.
1:41:02
Colbear's ordinance was motivated by the desire to fund the trading companies using private funds and not through the
1:41:10
government. So it had all the ingredients for a classic capital markets upswing. At the same time, law
1:41:18
also created the company of the west. The company of the west or the
1:41:23
Mississippi Company was a trading company with monopoly rights in French Louisiana, half of the present-day
1:41:29
United States. law allowed French government debt to be used to purchase shares in the
1:41:35
Mississippi Company. With a new company that had an exciting story about exploiting the opportunities of the new
1:41:42
frontier and a bank and government finances supporting this endeavor, all the right ingredients were in place. As
1:41:49
the company expanded, state debt holders jumped at the ability to convert their debt into equity. This created what was
1:41:56
perceived to be a great investment. Would you have bought in? Would I have bought in? If we didn't, would we have
1:42:03
had regrets? The stock soared, eventually becoming a bubble in the classic ways
1:42:09
these things happen. When it burst, both shares and bills rapidly lost their
1:42:14
value because of the classic reason of the outstanding claims on real assets being much greater than the real assets
1:42:21
that were backing up the claims. Naturally, people in France fled from
1:42:26
the depreciating paper money toward hard currency coinage. New laws prohibited
1:42:32
charging interest rates above 5%, which meant that only the most creditw worthy borrowers and most stable investments
1:42:39
could receive capital. As a result, it became nearly impossible for new businesses to receive funding. There
1:42:46
wasn't enough real money. On top of that, and quite typically, expensive wars made financial
1:42:54
conditions worse. A partial list of wars that France was in
1:42:59
follows. War of the League of Augsburg 1688
1:43:04
to97. France under the leadership of Louis the 14th expanded into modern-day
1:43:10
Western Germany, spurring war against England, Spain, Austria, and a number of
1:43:15
German states. War of the Spanish Succession 1701
1:43:21
to4 France allied with Spain fought an alliance of England, Austria and the
1:43:27
Netherlands to contest the inheritance of the Spanish throne. The war ended with the French heir taking the throne
1:43:33
of Spain, but with various concessions made to the other powers, including giving up Spanish territory in Italy and
1:43:41
Belgium to Austria, and France giving England and the Netherlands colonial and trade
1:43:47
concessions. War of the Austrian Succession 1740 to48.
1:43:53
France in alliance with Spain, Prussia and other German principalities fought
1:43:58
against Austria and the UK in support of the German prince's territorial ambitions against
1:44:04
Austria. 7 years war 1756-63. France allied with Austria,
1:44:12
Sweden and Russia fought against Britain and Prussia over German territories and
1:44:17
French and British colonies abroad particularly in North America. This war is also known as the French and Indian
1:44:25
War. American Revolution 1775 to83. France and Spain allied with the
1:44:32
American Revolutionary Forces against the British government. While a number of these wars
1:44:39
produced territorial and strategic gains for France, they turned out to cost much more than they brought in, which
1:44:46
eventually severely damaged the French government's finances. Without a modern
1:44:51
financial system, France had more difficulty funding its government through debt than Britain did. So, it
1:44:57
had to rely more on burdensome taxes, which were unpopular. One example of France's
1:45:03
inferior financial position affecting its geopolitical position is the differences in experiences of the
1:45:10
British and the French during the American Revolution. The French paid for the war effort entirely by floating
1:45:16
loans at interest rates at least double those the British government faced. This
1:45:21
caused France's debt service payments to rise to over 14 million compared to
1:45:27
Britain's £7 million. Both had national debts of around £220
1:45:33
million. Because the nobility, clergy, and even certain privileged towns often
1:45:38
paid lower taxes, high levels of taxation on the rest of society were imposed. That exacerbated France's
1:45:46
already high income inequality. Many French laborers struggled to meet their basic needs.
1:45:53
That caused more class warfare. Along with extreme income
1:45:58
inequality, there was corruption and extravagance at the top. The court of
1:46:03
King Louis V 16th was infamous for its frivolous spending. For instance, Maria
1:46:08
Antuinet's hamlet, an ornamental farm near the gardens of Versailles, built at great expense to replicate a rustic
1:46:15
village. Two major wars, the 7 Years War and the American Revolution, led to
1:46:21
massive deficits. During the American Revolution, the deficits were around 2 to 3% of GDP and about a third of
1:46:29
France's annual tax revenue. Meanwhile, the American Revolution further
1:46:34
popularized enlightenment ideas of liberty and equality. While bad harvests in 1788 and 1789 led to soaring bread
1:46:43
prices and famines, it was a recipe for revolution. Due to France's inefficient
1:46:50
and unrepresentative political decision-making system, the government was unable to raise needed revenues or
1:46:57
enact needed changes. Decisions from the ACSEAN regime could be and often were
1:47:03
undermined at virtually every lower level. The nobility and clergy resisted
1:47:08
decisions that hurt them and were able to carve out broad privileges for
1:47:13
themselves. Local authorities called parliaments were needed to enact tax policy but often resisted doing so. The
1:47:21
closest thing France had to a legislative body was the estates general, where representatives of
1:47:27
France's three estates, the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners, met to
1:47:32
approve certain legislation when summoned by the king. Its consent was seen as necessary to levy new national
1:47:40
taxes. However, its powers and procedures were unclear, and basic
1:47:45
questions like how representatives were chosen and how many votes each estate got were
1:47:51
unsettled. In 1789, the third estate, representing the commoners, who made up
1:47:57
98% of the population, formed its own assembly, inviting members of the first
1:48:02
and second estates to join it. To stop this national assembly from meeting, the
1:48:08
king closed their meeting hall. Protests, riots, and insurrection arose.
1:48:15
In 1791, a newly elected national convention declared France a republic.
1:48:21
And in January 1793, Louis V 16th, by then officially called Citizen Louie,
1:48:27
was sentenced to death. As is classic in revolutions, violence began soon after
1:48:33
in which those who were deemed insufficiently zealous were purged. It is estimated that between 20,000 and
1:48:41
30,000 people were executed during the French reign of terror. By 1795, France
1:48:47
was broke and the Asena, the currency it printed to finance government spending,
1:48:52
was experiencing hyperinflation. This is illustrated in the next PDF chart.
1:48:59
As is also classic, the revolution led to a counterreaction in which the revolution's leaders were themselves
1:49:06
arrested and a new constitution written and approved. The new system, the
1:49:11
directorate, proved to be ineffective and was immediately crippled by financial problems. Still, the
1:49:18
government continued to print money and forced wealthy citizens to loan it funds. Ultimately, the inflationary
1:49:26
spiral was halted by the introduction of the hard currency that was acquired through Napoleon's successful military
1:49:32
conquests in Italy and the decision to declare bankruptcy on 2/3 of the government's debt. Additional measures
1:49:40
such as increased taxes further strengthened the government's fiscal condition. In 1796, the government held
1:49:47
a ceremony in which it destroyed the presses it had been using to print money. See the next PDF
1:49:56
chart. Enter Napoleon. The bubble, the big wealth
1:50:01
gaps, and the costly expense of war led to the bust and then to revolution,
1:50:07
which threw out the old order and put in a new one. That new order consisted of
1:50:12
revolutionary leaders who fought with each other, producing 10 years of painful chaos that required a strong
1:50:19
leader to get control of the mess. It was all consistent with the classic
1:50:24
melodramatic script that is played innumerable times in the past. As if on
1:50:29
Q, Napoleon entered the picture. Napoleon was the classic hero rising to
1:50:36
the occasion. He had gained a sterling reputation as a military commander as France attempted to spread its
1:50:42
republican system across Europe. And he was very popular. So in 1799 he led a
1:50:49
coup to install himself as first console and eventually emperor and held
1:50:54
dictatorial powers until 1814. Armed with centralized power and
1:51:00
widespread support, he stabilized the economy and professionalized the government. France was widely seen as an
1:51:07
empire on the rise and a formidable rival to other European powers. When Austria and Russia declared
1:51:15
war on France, Napoleon scored sizable early military victories. Before long,
1:51:21
he controlled Spain, Portugal, Italy, and much of Germany. I won't go through
1:51:27
the history of the Napoleonic Wars, except to say that like other such leaders, he
1:51:33
overreached. Napoleon's invasion of Russia swung the tide of war against
1:51:38
him. In the end, France was defeated. Great Britain and Russia were the
1:51:43
primary victors. It should be noted that a significant factor in the war was the
1:51:50
UK's much greater financial strength. Because of their financial strength, the
1:51:55
UK was able to lend a lot of money to the European coalition forces against France. It was both its financial
1:52:02
resources and its naval power that allowed Britain to stay in the fight even as it and its allies suffered
1:52:09
repeated defeats. A new world order. The Congress of
1:52:16
Vienna. By now you know how these things go. After a war, the victors come
1:52:21
together and create a new world order. That happened at the Congress of Vienna.
1:52:26
Just as the victors of the 30 years war had done at West Failia, the quadruple alliance of Great Britain, Austria,
1:52:34
Prussia, and Russia reorganized the world order in their favor at the Congress of Vienna 1814 to 15, creating
1:52:42
a system of checks and balances among the European powers that would more or less hold for the next century. The
1:52:49
geopolitical importance of these developments is well described by Henry Kissinger.
1:52:55
It may not have fulfilled all the hopes of an idealistic generation, but it gave this generation something perhaps more
1:53:02
precious. A period of stability which permitted their hopes to be realized without a major war or a permanent
1:53:09
revolution. The period of stability which ensued was the best proof that a
1:53:14
legitimate order had been constructed. An order accepted by all the major powers so that henceforth they sought
1:53:21
adjustment within its framework rather than in its overthrow.
1:53:27
All the major powers were represented in Vienna, though the most important decisions were negotiated by the core
1:53:34
group and France itself. Like the US at the Paris Peace Conference after World
1:53:39
War I and in the negotiations after World War II, the UK didn't seek to gain
1:53:44
significant new territories. Its primary goal was to address the power imbalances
1:53:50
in Europe that had led to wars. Areas that had previously consisted of weak and divided states such as Italy,
1:53:57
Germany, and the Low Countries saw significant territorial consolidation to counterbalance more centralized states
1:54:04
like France, while agreements on the navigation of international rivers supported the expansion of trade.
1:54:11
Tactically, the treaties of Paris aimed to contain but not destroy France, which
1:54:17
suffered only a minimal loss of territory. The Treaty of Paris in 1814
1:54:22
saw France restore its borders to what they were in 1792, which meant France
1:54:28
actually got back some of the colonial territories that the UK had taken during the wars. The Treaty of Paris in 1815
1:54:36
after Napoleon returned from exile and was defeated a second and final time was
1:54:42
less favorable, requiring France to pay a large indemnity except an army of
1:54:47
occupation and seed some additional territory, but still left France with the vast majority of the land it had
1:54:54
controlled at the time of the French Revolution. The victorious powers were all
1:54:59
monarchies and many of the policies they enacted were aimed at restoring the old status quo. For example, returning the
1:55:06
Bourban dynasty to power in France. Even so, the new ideas of the Enlightenment
1:55:13
continued to have influence. Governments shifted to more representative and rule of law-based systems, though to varying
1:55:20
degrees. Tsarist Russia remained largely autocratic. In England, the
1:55:26
liberalization came about as a result of gradual reforms. While on the continent, a series of revolutions, most famously,
1:55:34
the liberal revolutions of 1848, spurred the changes. In time, nationalist
1:55:40
movements led to the unification of Germany and Italy, as well as the destabilization of the multithnic
1:55:46
Austrian and Ottoman empires. British power approaches its
1:55:53
peak. No power benefited more from the new stability than the British Empire. Not
1:56:01
only were Britain's main economic and military rivals weakened, but the power equilibrium allowed the UK to avoid
1:56:08
expensive military conflicts close to home and focus on trade and its colonies, a policy known as splendid
1:56:15
isolation, which set the stage for its imperial century. Of course, there were
1:56:21
some bad economic periods during those years. For example, the panic of 1825 in
1:56:27
the UK and the panics of 1837 and 1873 in the US. And there were military
1:56:34
conflicts, for example, the Crimean War between Russia on one side and the Ottoman Empire and a coalition of
1:56:41
Western European powers on the other. But these were not significant enough to
1:56:46
change the big picture which was of a very prosperous period with the British on top. As mentioned at their peak in
1:56:54
the late 19th century around 1870, the British produced 20% of the world's
1:57:00
income and controlled 40% of global exports, 20% of the world's land mass
1:57:06
and 25% of the world's population. and the pound, of course, became the world's
1:57:12
undisputed reserve currency. The next PDF charts help paint
1:57:17
the picture of Britain's dominant strength. Geopolitically, the UK
1:57:23
continued to expand abroad throughout the 19th century, eventually encompassing Canada, Australia, India,
1:57:30
and large portions of Africa. A crucial dimension of the UK's early expansion
1:57:36
was the role played by the British East India Company, which starting in the late 18th century and continuing into
1:57:42
the 19th century consolidated its political and economic control of modern-day India, Pakistan, and
1:57:49
Bangladesh. This vast area remained under the private control of the company until a
1:57:55
major rebellion in 1857 led the British state to step in and take over India as
1:58:01
a British territory. And even where the British Empire didn't explicitly take control,
1:58:08
it was increasingly able to intervene abroad in order to gain trade access on
1:58:13
uneven terms. For example, the opium wars against China, ending with a treaty
1:58:18
ensuring the UK's ability to export opium to China despite local Chinese
1:58:24
laws against it. Maintaining these colonies gave the UK an assured source
1:58:29
of commodities, wealth, and income, and preferential trade arrangements. The next PDF chart clearly
1:58:37
paints the picture. the
1:58:42
top. The pound's status as a reserve currency complemented its dominance in
1:58:48
colonial expansion, military reach, global trade, and investment flows. The
1:58:54
UK's share of global exports rose with the industrial revolution and the spread of the empire, peaking around 1850 at
1:59:02
about 40% of global exports. And the share of trade denominated in sterling
1:59:07
was greater than the UK's trade share alone. From 1850 to 1914, around 60% of global
1:59:15
trade was denominated in pounds. This set of conditions sewed the seeds of the
1:59:21
decline that typify the top phase of the big cycle. Please see the next PDF
1:59:27
chart, GBR share of world exports. Even as the UK's share of world
1:59:33
exports declined, the UK ran a persistent current account surplus throughout this period. After 1870, this
1:59:42
was comprised of a persistent trade deficit funded by returns on overseas
1:59:47
investments. The income from the current account surpluses funded an increasing share of global crossborder investment
1:59:54
as other countries become more attractive to invest in. Please see the next PDF chart.
2:00:02
In 1818, the English Rothschild Bank made its first major government loan to
2:00:08
Prussia. As the pound became increasingly liquid, a wave of other sovereign borrowers followed, and global
2:00:15
debt, global trade, and global capital flows all came to be increasingly denominated in Sterling. While there
2:00:23
were widespread private holdings of pounds internationally, it's worth noting that for most of the 1800s, there
2:00:30
wasn't much in the way of central bank holdings, particularly relative to the role that the dollar plays in central
2:00:36
bank portfolios today. Through World War I, central bank assets outside their own currency were
2:00:43
generally held in precious metals. Trust in the pound was bolstered by the
2:00:48
economic management of the Bank of England, which increasingly operated as a lender of last resort to mitigate the
2:00:55
effects of banking panics. The panic of 1866 demonstrates this. Well, to
2:01:02
simplify the events, the London money markets were the most liquid markets for trade finance. But after a decade of
2:01:09
boom, lots of lenders were overextended and a big one, Overend Gurnie Company
2:01:15
went bust. It was the 19th century equivalent of Layman Brothers. However,
2:01:21
the crisis resolved within days as the Bank of England's demonstrated willingness to serve as the lender of
2:01:28
last resort stemmed the loss of confidence in the system. Please see the
2:01:33
next PDF charts. Even as the British Empire continued to
2:01:38
expand its territorial and financial reach over the final decades of the 19th century, the seeds of its fall were
2:01:46
evident, driven by the classic factors of one, declining competitiveness, two,
2:01:52
rising inequality and conflict, and three, the rise of new rivals, particularly Germany and the
2:02:00
US. Declining competitiveness. Stepping back, the broader story of
2:02:06
economic growth in the mid to late 1800s was the second industrial revolution. A
2:02:12
sustained period of innovation in which science as well as engineering played a major role as synthetics and new alloys
2:02:19
were produced and the use of new energy sources like petroleum and electricity exploded. This was when the telephone
2:02:26
and the incandescent light bulb were developed and automobiles soon followed.
2:02:32
Transportation, communications, and infrastructure improved, and the rise of corporate capitalism enhanced
2:02:39
productivity. The result was a sizable increase in output per worker in the countries able to make the switch
2:02:45
efficiently, primarily the US and Germany. The UK didn't keep up, even
2:02:51
though British inventions were key to many of these new developments. The UK's failure to reorganize its
2:02:58
industries led to marked declines in output per worker relative to the other leading industrial powers. You can see
2:03:05
the secular shift in innovation and economic power in the following PDF
2:03:12
charts. Rising inequality. The gains from industrialization were distributed very
2:03:19
unevenly in the UK, producing extreme levels of inequality. By the late 1800s,
2:03:25
the top 1% of the population owned over 70% of all wealth, more than in peer
2:03:32
countries. The UK's top 10% owned an astounding 93% of its wealth. For
2:03:39
comparison, the top 1%'s share of wealth in the UK today is about 20% and the top
2:03:46
10% share is about 50%. As shown in the next PDF chart, the peak
2:03:52
in the wealth gap coincided with the peak in the British Empire around 1900,
2:03:57
which was the beginning of the next wave of conflict over wealth and power due to large wealth gaps and the classic late
2:04:04
big cycle conditions described in part one. The combination of social change
2:04:11
and rising inequality sparked significant tensions. England's policy
2:04:16
response in the mid 1800s focused largely on reform bills that expanded voting rights and reduced the corrupt
2:04:23
practices that had made elections less democratic. By the early 1900s, those
2:04:28
political reforms were followed by social reforms, which included the introduction of a public pension system,
2:04:35
medical and unemployment insurance, and the provision of free lunches for school children. Organized labor was also on
2:04:43
the rise, strengthening workers bargaining power. By 1911, around 25% of
2:04:49
eligible men were union members, and the Labor Party became a significant force in
2:04:55
politics. This greater power took the form of increasingly large strikes. For
2:05:00
example, the first national strike by coal miners in 1912, which led to a
2:05:05
minimum wage for miners. geopolitical rivals
2:05:12
emerge. In addition to its domestic issues, the UK faced challenges to its
2:05:17
empire abroad, competing for influence with France and Africa, Russia in the
2:05:23
Middle East and Central Asia, and the US and the Americas. Its most significant rivalry,
2:05:29
however, was with Germany. The United States, the other great rising power,
2:05:35
remained blissfully isolationist with a big ocean allowing it to largely ignore the conflicts in
2:05:41
Europe. When the new world order began at the Congress of Vienna, Germany was
2:05:47
still divided into a number of smaller states. While the Austrian Empire, ruled
2:05:52
by the Hapsburgs, had a lot of influence, Prussia was swiftly rising and had one of the strongest armies in
2:05:59
Europe. Over the next century, it successfully unified the other German states, becoming a first rate power. It
2:06:07
achieved this thanks in large part to Ottovon Bismar's brilliant strategic and diplomatic leadership and the other
2:06:14
classic ingredients for success, strong education, and competitiveness.
2:06:20
While Prussia and later the German Empire were monarchies ruled by the Hoenzalin family, Bismar had immensely
2:06:28
effective powers having been appointed by the monarch first as minister president of Prussia and then as
2:06:34
chancellor of Germany from unification in 1871 until 1890. According to historian Eric
2:06:41
Hobsbomb, Bismar remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost
2:06:49
20 years after 1871. Once unified, Germany experienced
2:06:54
the classic virtuous cycle of a power on the rise. Viewing an effective education
2:07:00
system as a crucial step in its quest to raise its economy to the level of Great Britain's, the New Germany and its
2:07:07
predecessor states built one from the ground up, focusing on teaching both practical trade skills and highlevel
2:07:14
scientific knowledge, theoretical and applied. Starting in the 1860s, primary
2:07:21
education was mandatory for all and enforced by law. Germany also
2:07:26
established three new research universities. Please see the PDF
2:07:32
graph. In order to create a culture of innovation, the German government provided credit to corporations along
2:07:39
with technical advice and assistance, awarded grants to inventors and immigrant entrepreneurs, bestowed gifts
2:07:46
of machinery, and allowed rebates and exemptions of duties on imports of industrial equipment.
2:07:53
Germany also maintained a strong rule of law which was explicitly aimed at economic
2:07:59
development. See this illustrated in the next PDF graph. As a result of these efforts,
2:08:06
Germany's share of the world's manufacturing output increased from about 5 to 13% between 1860 and 1900
2:08:15
while the other European powers shares stagnated or decreased. By 1900,
2:08:21
Germany's GDP had surpassed Britain's, excluding its empire, although the
2:08:26
latter was still the leading trading nation in the world, as shown in the next PDF
2:08:32
graph. While Bismar was a skilled diplomat who prioritized economic
2:08:37
development and diplomacy with international competitors, his successors were less skilled and more
2:08:44
aggressive. When Wilhelm II became emperor in 1888, he forced Bismar to
2:08:51
resign and adopted a policy of turning Germany into a world power. This led
2:08:57
other powers, primarily Russia and the UK, to increasingly align with France, a
2:09:02
bitter rival of Germany since the FrancoRussian War in 1871. In an effort to contain Germany,
2:09:10
Wilhelm moved to build up Germany's military, particularly its navy, setting
2:09:15
off an arms race with the UK. This began the next rivalry between
2:09:21
great powers. See the next PDF. The UK retained its naval
2:09:27
advantage, but the arms race strained the finances of the major powers and further destabilized the geopolitical
2:09:34
order. The rivalry between the UK and Germany was just one of many building
2:09:40
across Europe. France and Germany were at odds. Germany was increasingly concerned about Russian
2:09:46
industrialization, and Austria and Russia were struggling for influence in the Balkans. Though these countries were
2:09:53
intertwined through marriage and commerce more than ever before and despite most people believing it
2:10:00
wouldn't happen. In 1914, the powder keg exploded into allout
2:10:05
war. This was the first world war because this was the first time the
2:10:10
world had become so small and so interconnected that most of the major parts of the world were involved in one
2:10:17
way or another. Given the complexity and scale of World War I and how extensively it
2:10:24
has been written about, I will just attempt to convey the big picture. It was terrible. The war killed about 8.5
2:10:32
million soldiers and 13 million civilians, leaving all of Europe exhausted, weakened, and
2:10:39
indebted. Russia devolved into revolution in 1917. In 1918, the Spanish
2:10:45
flu arrived, killing an estimated 20 to 50 million people around the world over the next 2 years. As a percentage of the
2:10:53
European population, more people died during this time period than in either the Napoleonic Wars or 30 Years War. But
2:11:02
the war ended and the next new world order was created. In 1919, the victors, the US,
2:11:10
Britain, France, Japan, and Italy, met at the Paris Peace Conference to lay out
2:11:16
the new world order in the Treaty of Versailles. The United States, now
2:11:21
recognized as a leading power, played a big role in the negotiations. In fact, the term New
2:11:27
World Order was coined to describe US President Woodro Wilson's vision for a global governance system, the League of
2:11:35
Nations. Though this quickly failed, if the Congress of Vienna in
2:11:40
1815 had created a relatively sustainable order, the terms of the Paris Peace Conference did the opposite.
2:11:47
It made a second war inevitable, though it wasn't apparent at the time. The
2:11:52
territories of the losing powers, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, were carved up,
2:11:59
and they were forced to pay reparations to the victors. Those debt burdens
2:12:05
contributed to an inflationary depression in Germany from 1920 to
2:12:10
1923. Elsewhere, much of the world entered a decade of peace and prosperity, the roaring 20s. As is
2:12:17
typical, the debts and the wealth gaps that were built up burst in 1929, causing the Great
2:12:24
Depression. These two big boom and bust cycles came unusually close together,
2:12:30
though they followed the classic stages. I won't digress into the 1920s boom to
2:12:36
bust sequence here as it was covered elsewhere in this book, but I will pick up the story in the Great
2:12:43
Depression. The Great Depression coupled with the large wealth gaps led to a rise
2:12:49
in populism and extremism in nearly every major country. In some countries,
2:12:54
for example, the US and the UK, this led to big redistributions of wealth and
2:13:00
political power, while capitalism and democracy were maintained. In others,
2:13:05
particularly those with weaker economies, Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain,
2:13:11
populist dictators seized control and sought to expand their empires.
2:13:17
Classically, before allout wars begin, there is typically about a decade of
2:13:22
economic, technological, geopolitical, and capital skirmishing. The time between the
2:13:28
depression and World War II was consistent with this rule. As Germany
2:13:33
and Japan became more expansionist, they increasingly competed with the UK, the
2:13:39
US, and France for resources and influence over territories. Ultimately,
2:13:44
those tensions boiled over into war. World War II, just two decades
2:13:50
after World War I, was even more costly in lives and money. Germany and Japan
2:13:57
lost, and the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union won, though economically the UK
2:14:03
and the Soviet Union lost too. And the US gained enormously in relative wealth.
2:14:09
GDP per capita in Germany and Japan fell by at least half and their currencies
2:14:15
collapsed in the aftermath of the war as the next PDF charts show. The PDF charts show the official
2:14:22
exchange rate between dollars and Deutsche marks as well as an unofficial black market rate that was based on
2:14:29
actual transactions between New York and Germany during that time period. The
2:14:34
unofficial rate shows that the true value of the Deutsche mark was collapsing during the
2:14:40
period. As is typical, the winners of the war got together and determined a
2:14:45
new world order in 1945. The decline.
2:14:53
The Allied victory in 1945 produced a tremendous shift of wealth and power
2:14:59
with the US emerging as the world's dominant empire just as the British had after the Napoleonic Wars. The British
2:15:07
were left with large debts, a huge empire that was more expensive to maintain than it was profitable,
2:15:13
numerous rivals that were more competitive, and a population that had big wealth gaps that led to big
2:15:20
political gaps. It took another 20 years for the British pound to fully lose its status as an
2:15:27
international reserve currency. Just as the English language is so deeply woven into the fabric of
2:15:34
international business and diplomatic communications that it would be difficult to replace, the same is true
2:15:40
of reserve currencies. Other count's central banks continued to hold sizable
2:15:46
shares of their reserves in pounds through the 1950s and a third of all
2:15:52
international trade was still denominated in sterling in 1960. But the pound had been losing
2:15:58
status since the end of the war because smart investors recognized the great
2:16:04
contrast between the UK's and the US's financial conditions, the UK's increased
2:16:10
debt load and the UK's low net reserves, which would make holding pound sterling
2:16:15
debt a bad deal. The decline in the British pound was a
2:16:20
protracted affair that involved several significant devaluations. After attempts to make the
2:16:26
pound convertible failed in 1946 and 47, it was devalued by 30% against the
2:16:33
dollar in 1949. Though this worked in the short term, over the next two decades, Britain's
2:16:40
declining competitiveness led to repeated balance of payment strains that culminated with the devaluation of
2:16:48
1967. Around this time, the Deutsche mark took the pound's place as the world's second most widely held reserve
2:16:56
currency. The next PDF charts paint the picture.
2:17:02
The pound's suspended convertability in 1947 and its devaluation in
2:17:09
1949. The 1940s are frequently referred to as crisis years for the pound. The
2:17:16
war required the UK to borrow immensely from its allies and colonies and those
2:17:21
obligations were required to be held in sterling. When the war ended, the UK
2:17:27
could not meet its debt obligations without either raising taxes or cutting government spending. So, it necessarily
2:17:34
mandated that its debt assets, that is its bonds, could not be proactively sold
2:17:39
by its former colonies. The US was anxious for the UK to restore
2:17:45
convertability as soon as possible as the restrictions were reducing liquidity in the global economy, affecting the
2:17:52
US's export profits. The Bank of England was also eager to remove capital
2:17:57
controls in order to restore the pound's role as a global trading currency, increase financial sector revenues in
2:18:04
London, and encourage international investors to continue saving in sterling. In 1946, an agreement was
2:18:12
reached in which the US would provide the UK with a loan of $3.75 billion,
2:18:18
about 10% of UK GDP, to offer a buffer against a potential run on the pound. As
2:18:26
expected, the pound came under considerable selling pressure when partial convertability was introduced in
2:18:32
July 1947 and the UK and the sterling area countries turned to austerity to
2:18:39
maintain the pounds peg to the dollar. Restrictions were imposed on the import
2:18:44
of luxury goods. Defense expenditures were slashed. Dollar and gold reserves
2:18:49
were drawn down. and agreements were made among sterling economies to not diversify their reserve holdings to the
2:18:57
dollar. Prime Minister Clement Atley gave a dramatic speech calling for the spirit of wartime
2:19:04
sacrifice. We are engaged in another battle for Britain. This battle cannot be won by the few. It demands a united
2:19:12
effort by the whole nation. I am confident that this united effort will be forthcoming and that we shall again
2:19:20
conquer. Immediately following the speech, the run on the pound accelerated. By the end of August,
2:19:27
convertability was suspended, much to the anger of the US and other international investors who had bought
2:19:34
sterling assets in the leadup to convertability. The governor of the National Bank of
2:19:39
Belgium threatened to stop transacting in Sterling, requiring a diplomatic intervention. The devaluation came 2
2:19:47
years later as policymakers in both the UK and the US realized that the pound
2:19:53
couldn't return to convertability at the current rate. Competitiveness returned,
2:19:58
the current account improved, and by the mid to late 1950s, full convertability
2:20:04
was restored. The next PDF charts paint the picture. The devaluation did not lead to
2:20:11
a panic out of sterling even though the fundamentals remained poor because a
2:20:16
very large share of UK assets was held by the US government which was willing to take the valuation hit in order to
2:20:24
restore convertability and by sterling area economies such as India and
2:20:29
Australia whose currencies were pegged to the pound for political reasons.
2:20:34
Still, the immediate post-war experience made it clear to knowledgeable observers that the pound would not enjoy the same
2:20:41
international role it had prior to World War II. The failed international efforts to
2:20:49
support the pound in the 1950s and 1960s and the devaluation of 1967.
2:20:57
Though the 1949 devaluation helped in the short term, the pound faced
2:21:03
recurring balance of payment strains. These were very concerning to international policy makers who feared
2:21:09
that a collapse in the value of sterling or a rapid shift to the dollar could prove highly detrimental to the new
2:21:16
Bretonwoods monetary system, particularly given the backdrop of the Cold War and concerns around communism.
2:21:24
As a result, numerous efforts were made to shore up the pound and preserve its role as a source of international
2:21:31
liquidity. In addition, the UK mandated that all trade within the common market
2:21:36
would be denominated in pounds and all its currencies pegged to sterling. The
2:21:42
result was that for the 1950s and early 1960s, the UK was best understood as a
2:21:48
regional economic power and sterling as a regional reserve currency.
2:21:53
Yet those measures still didn't fix the problem. The UK was too indebted and too
2:21:59
uncompetitive. It couldn't pay its debts and still buy what it needed to import.
2:22:05
Sterling had to be devalued again in 1967. After that, even sterling area
2:22:12
countries were unwilling to hold their reserves in pounds unless the UK guaranteed their underlying value in
2:22:18
dollars. Please see the next PDF charts. After the devaluation, little
2:22:25
faith remained in the pound. Central banks began to sell their sterling reserves and buy dollars, Deutsche
2:22:32
marks, and yen as opposed to simply accumulating fewer pounds in new reserve
2:22:38
holdings. The average share of sterling and central bank reserve holdings collapsed within 2 years.
2:22:45
Countries that continued to hold a high share of their reserves in pounds after 1968 were holding de facto dollars
2:22:53
because the sterling agreement of 1968 guaranteed 90% of their dollar value.
2:23:00
Please see the next PDF chart. Europe after World War
2:23:07
II. As we've seen again and again, the terrible costs of war push countries to
2:23:13
create new world orders in their aftermaths in an attempt to ensure that such wars can never happen again.
2:23:20
Naturally, new world orders revolve around the victor, which is often the newly ascendant empire. After World War
2:23:28
II, that was clearly the US. The most important geopolitical elements
2:23:33
of the post-war order were the US was the dominant power which
2:23:38
made it the de facto global police force. Naturally, tensions almost
2:23:44
immediately arose between the US and the world's second leading power, the Soviet Union. The US and its allies formed a
2:23:51
military alliance called NATO, and the Soviet states formed the Warsaw Pact,
2:23:57
and the two faced off in the Cold War. The United Nations was established to
2:24:03
resolve global disputes. As is classic, it was headquartered in the heart of the
2:24:08
Ascendant Empire, in this case, New York, with its main power organ, the Security Council, dominated by the war's
2:24:16
victors, as is also classic. The most important financial elements of
2:24:22
the new world order consisted of the Bretonwoods monetary system which
2:24:27
established the dollar as the world's reserve currency, the IMF and the World Bank
2:24:33
designed to support the new global financial system, New York as the new
2:24:38
global financial center. From the European perspective, the key aspect of the new world order
2:24:45
was the shift from a balance of power in which the preeminent European powers were on top to a world in which they
2:24:53
were exhausted and overshadowed by new superpowers that dwarfed any one European state, especially as their
2:25:00
colonies gained independence. Given these pressures and the clear lesson of the costs of division that the
2:25:07
world wars had taught, the value of European unity was clear. That was the
2:25:12
impetus for the new European order that gradually developed into the European
2:25:18
Union. The story of Robert Schuman, a key founder of the EU, helps explain why
2:25:24
Europe came together. Schuman's father was a French citizen who became a German citizen when his home region of Alsas
2:25:32
Lurraine was annexed by the Germans in 1871. Schuman was born a German citizen
2:25:38
but became a French citizen when Alsraine was returned to France after World War I. As a politician in World
2:25:46
War II, he joined the Vichi government before abandoning it for the French resistance. He ended the war in hiding
2:25:53
with a 100,000 Reichkes mark bounty on his head. A key partner to Schuman was
2:25:59
West Germany's first postwar chancellor, Conrad Adenau. A centrist mayor, he had
2:26:05
been driven from political life by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp in
2:26:11
1944. Following his election as chancellor as a Christian Democrat in 1949, his policies focused on rebuilding
2:26:19
the German economy. reconciling with other European powers and opposing
2:26:24
communism. Schuman and Adnau's project along with the rest of the EU's founders
2:26:30
was to make war not merely unthinkable but materially
2:26:35
impossible. Their first step was to create the European Coal and Steel Community. It sounds like a narrow
2:26:42
economic pact, but its explicit goal was to create a European federation. from the Schuman
2:26:50
Declaration. The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common
2:26:56
foundations for economic development as a first step in the Federation of Europe
2:27:02
and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacturer of munitions of war of
2:27:09
which they have been the most constant victims. The agreement created super national
2:27:15
bodies, a high authority, a common assembly, and a court of justice that
2:27:21
bound individual countries to its decisions and regulations, had the ability to levy taxes, could issue loans
2:27:28
and set up programs for worker welfare. Six nations signed on and more
2:27:34
joined over time. Eventually, it evolved into a customs union in 1957 via the
2:27:41
Treaty of Rome, opened up count's borders in 1985 via the Shangen
2:27:46
Agreement, and eventually agreed on the framework for a political and economic union, including a shared European
2:27:54
citizenship in 1992 via the Mastrict Treaty. As is classic, this new European
2:28:01
geopolitical order came with a new financial economic order. The Mastrict
2:28:07
Treaty created the basis for a new common currency, the euro, and common
2:28:12
economic rules, including rules around government deficits. The integration of its 27 member states and their more than
2:28:19
400 million people, many of whom had been at war with one another in the past, is an impressive feat, one that
2:28:27
puts the EU on a similar standing to the other great powers. See the next PDF chart.
2:28:34
The European Union's relative declines and crises in the early 21st century
2:28:40
occurred for the classic reasons big cycle declines occurred, which are reflected in the eight measures of power
2:28:47
and other indicators described in chapter 2. These are the same reasons that other empires have experienced
2:28:54
crisis. More specifically, Europe's debt is large. Its economy is fundamentally
2:29:00
weak. Its internal conflicts are relatively large. Its vitality and level of inventiveness are relatively weak.
2:29:08
And its military is not strong. The wealth and income inequalities between
2:29:13
and within its member countries have fueled the rise of populists, many of whom opposed the European Union and who
2:29:20
succeeded in causing the UK to leave it. In short, from its position of a leading
2:29:25
empire not long ago, Europe as a whole and the UK with it has slipped to a
2:29:31
position of secondary power, as shown in the next PDF graph. Let's now turn our attentions to
2:29:38
the American and Chinese powers. Chapter 11, the big cycle rise
Chapter 11: The Big Cycle Rise and Decline of the United States and the Dollar
2:29:46
and decline of the United States and the dollar.
2:29:51
This chapter covers the big cycle rise of the US beginning in the 19th century,
2:29:57
its gradual surpassing of the UK as the world's most powerful empire, and its
2:30:02
recent decline. As the story of the US as the world's leading empire is still
2:30:08
unfolding and is highly relevant to the world today, I will be going through its
2:30:13
big cycle in more detail than I did for the Dutch and British, especially as it relates to the dollar's status as a
2:30:20
global reserve currency and the economic and monetary policy forces that have impacted
2:30:26
it. The next PDF chart shows the eight types of power that make up our overall
2:30:32
US arc. In them, you can see the story behind the US's rise and decline since
2:30:39
1700. The strong development and excellence in education led to advances in innovation and technology,
2:30:46
competitiveness in world markets and economic output. All of which fueled the
2:30:51
development of financial markets and the US as a financial center, its leadership and military strength and world trade
2:30:58
and with a significant lag, the emergence of the dollar as a reserve
2:31:04
currency. The relative advantages in education, competitiveness, and trade have fallen while those in innovation
2:31:10
and technology, reserve currency status and financial markets and financial center status remain strong.
2:31:19
What this PDF chart doesn't show are the deviations in the US income and balance
2:31:24
sheet conditions and its internal conflicts, both of which are more concerning. For a more complete current
2:31:31
picture, hear the final chapter of this book. This next PDF chart combines all
2:31:38
the factors to show the overall arc of the US from before the Revolutionary War, marking the key events along the
2:31:46
way. The numbers mark the approximate times of the six stages of the internal
2:31:51
order cycle. Now we will go through the US's story from the beginning until the time
2:31:58
of my writing. The rise. As with all new countries and
2:32:05
dynasties, the US went through the usual revolution and post-revolution process
2:32:11
in which it created a new domestic order as one, a coordinated group of strong
2:32:16
leaders fought to gain control. Two, that group won and consolidated control.
2:32:23
Three, the new leadership had a vision supported by the population. But four,
2:32:29
it split into factions that had conflicts over how the government should work to implement that vision.
2:32:36
Eventually, these factions, five, figured out the system for control and
2:32:41
laid it out in agreements in the US case at first in the Articles of Confederation and then in the
2:32:47
Constitution. Six, set up the parts of government, for example, the money and credit system,
2:32:54
the legal system, the legislative systems, the military, etc. And seven,
2:33:00
put people in jobs and made it work well. The US did these things in a
2:33:06
uniquely peaceful way through negotiations, near total respect for agreements, and good designs for
2:33:12
governance that gave it a great start. In the PDF chart showing the
2:33:18
eight types of power, you can see that rapidly improving levels of education
2:33:23
preceded the big rises in innovation, technology, and competitiveness which lasted until the world wars with an
2:33:30
interruption during the US Civil War. There were many ups and downs in both
2:33:35
domestic and external money, debt, economic and military circumstances. I
2:33:41
won't take you through them in detail, though I will note that all of them followed the archetypical patterns
2:33:47
driven by the same basic cause effect relationships previously described here.
2:33:53
While the ascent of the US was most pronounced after World War II, it really
2:33:58
started in the late 1800s. That's where we'll pick up the story.
2:34:03
After the US civil war came the second industrial revolution which was one of
2:34:08
those classic times in which the peaceful pursuit of wealth and prosperity created great gains in
2:34:15
incomes, technologies and wealth in England, continental Europe and the United States. In the US, these gains
2:34:22
were financed through a system of free market capitalism that as is classic
2:34:28
produced both lots of wealth and big wealth gaps. These gaps led to discontent and
2:34:34
progressive era policies that broke up rich and powerful monopolies, trustbusting, and raised taxes on the
2:34:42
rich, starting with the passage of a constitutional amendment to allow federal income taxes in 1913.
2:34:50
The US's increased strengths were reflected in its rising shares of global economic output and world trade as well
2:34:57
as its growing financial strength exemplified by New York becoming the world's leading financial center,
2:35:04
continuing leadership in innovation and great usage of its financial products.
2:35:11
The long ascent of the dollar and US capital markets. The dollar's path to being the
2:35:18
world's dominant reserve currency was far from straightforward. In the US's
2:35:23
first century of existence, its financial system was completely underdeveloped. Banking worked in the
2:35:30
United States in the classic ways it did in most countries, as I described in chapters 3 and four. In other words,
2:35:37
hard money was put into banks that together lent out much more than they had. That Ponzi scheme unraveled, so
2:35:45
banks failed to meet their commitments and devalued the money. The US had no
2:35:51
central bank to control financial markets or act as a lender of last resort. The US went through many boom
2:35:58
bust cycles in which classically a flurry of debt financed investments into
2:36:03
land, railroads, etc. became overextended leading to credit losses
2:36:08
and a credit crunch. As a result, banking system panics were extremely
2:36:14
common. In New York alone, eight significant banking panics occurred between 1836 and 1913, and regional
2:36:22
banking panics were also common. This was because the highly fragmented banking system had a rigid amount of
2:36:29
currency, no deposit insurance, and a parameal reserve system with a small
2:36:34
number of large banks in New York serving as correspondence or holding reserves for a high percentage of the
2:36:41
nation's banks that heightened the risk of contagion from one bank going under.
2:36:48
Like London, New York was well established as a trading center long before it became a global financial
2:36:54
center, a development that didn't occur until after the turn of the 20th century. Only two US banks made the list
2:37:01
of the top 20 largest global banks in 1913 at numbers 13 and 17. In
2:37:08
comparison, British banks occupied nine slots, including three of the top five.
2:37:14
For perspective, at this point the US was far larger than the UK in economic
2:37:20
output and they were neck andneck in export market share. Many of the most important
2:37:26
financial innovations in the emerging New York financial center came out of its needs as a large trading center.
2:37:33
Investment banking took off in the US and emerged in the 1800s as a clearing
2:37:38
house for capital, much of it flowing from Europe to finance the US boom over
2:37:44
the period. Like in London earlier, insurance companies developed more rapidly than banking. In the pre-war
2:37:51
period, the large insurance trusts were bigger than the large banks. The fact that the US economy was more
2:37:59
dynamic and rapidly changing compared to European and British markets was also
2:38:04
reflected in the US stock market which boomed starting right after the US civil war. As previously explained, the second
2:38:12
half of the 19th century was a boom period of peace and prosperity that has been called the second industrial
2:38:19
revolution, the Gilded Age, and the robber baron era because it was the period in which capitalism and
2:38:26
innovation flourished, wealth gaps widened enormously, decadence was apparent, and resentment built. The
2:38:34
backlash started around 1900 and there was a classic debt bust in
2:38:39
1907. This turbulence led to the creation of the Federal Reserve central banking system in
2:38:45
1913. By 1910, US stock market capitalization had surpassed that of
2:38:51
Great Britain. New sectors and companies rose to prominence quickly, such as US
2:38:56
Steel, which was founded in 1901 and became the most valuable US company only
2:39:02
15 years later. Then World War I, the war few people expected to happen and nobody
2:39:09
expected to last so long, began in 1914 and ended in 1918.
2:39:15
The US was not in World War I for most of it and was the only major country to
2:39:21
maintain convertability to gold during the war. Not only were the economies and
2:39:26
markets of Europe badly hurt from the wartime efforts, but the policies undertaken by European governments also
2:39:33
further undermined the faith in their currencies. In contrast, the United States relative financial and economic
2:39:40
position benefited from the war. that the allies wartime debts were largely
2:39:46
owed to the US boosted the use of the dollar for denominating global government
2:39:52
debt. Following the standard script, the winning powers, in this case the US,
2:39:57
Britain, France, Japan, and Italy met after the war to set out the new world
2:40:03
order. That meeting called the Paris Peace Conference took place in early 1919, lasted for 6 months, and led to
2:40:11
the Treaty of Versailles. In that treaty, the territories of the losing powers, Germany, Austria,
2:40:18
Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, were carved up and put under the control of the winning empires. The
2:40:25
losing powers were put into deep debt to the winning powers to repay the winning count's war costs. These debts were
2:40:32
payable in gold. See the PDF graph. Geopolitically, the United States
2:40:39
also benefited because it played a key role in shaping the new world order. Though it remained more isolationist,
2:40:46
while Britain continued to expand and oversee its global colonial empire, the
2:40:52
monetary system in the immediate post-war period was in flux. While most countries endeavored to restore gold
2:40:59
convertability, currency stability against gold came only after a period of sharp devaluations and inflation.
2:41:07
As is typical after the war years and with the new world order came a period
2:41:13
of peace and prosperity fueled by great innovations and productivity and a
2:41:18
capital markets boom that produced big debts and big wealth gaps late in the
2:41:23
upswing in the roaring 20s. A lot of debt promises to deliver paper money
2:41:28
that was convertible to gold was created to buy speculative assets, particularly
2:41:34
stocks. To curtail that, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy in
2:41:40
1929, which caused the bubble to burst and the global great depression to begin. It brought economic suffering to
2:41:48
virtually all nations which led to fighting over wealth within and between countries which led to the hot wars that
2:41:55
began a decade later. I covered the events leading up to and during World War II in depth in
2:42:02
chapter 6 as an example of the war period of the big external order disorder cycle. The important thing to
2:42:10
remember here is that the Allied victory in 1945 produced the next shift in the
2:42:16
world order. It was a tremendous shift of wealth and power. On a relative
2:42:21
basis, the US came out the big winner because the US sold and lent a lot before and during the war. Basically,
2:42:29
all of the fighting took place off of US territory. So the US wasn't physically
2:42:34
damaged and US deaths were comparatively low in relation to those of most other
2:42:39
major countries. The top the post-war
2:42:46
geopolitical and military system. Following the standard script,
2:42:52
the victorious powers met to determine the new world order and its new money and credit systems. The US, Russia, then
2:43:00
the USSR, and Great Britain emerged from the fighting as the world's great powers. With the US clearly the richest
2:43:07
and most powerful militarily, Germany, Japan, and Italy were largely destroyed. Great Britain
2:43:14
was essentially bankrupt, and France was devastated by the war and contributed little to the
2:43:20
victory. China was in civil war, which resumed right after Japan's surrender.
2:43:26
While there was relatively good cooperation between the US and Russia immediately after the war, it didn't
2:43:33
take long for the two greatest powers with opposing ideologies to enter a cold
2:43:38
war. The next PDF chart shows the aggregate power indices for the US, the
2:43:44
UK, Russia, and China since the end of World War II. As you can see, Russia
2:43:50
rose relative to the US until 1980, but it was never nearly as powerful, though
2:43:56
it was much more powerful than China. After 1980, Russia began its decline,
2:44:02
while China then began its rapid ascent, and the US continued its gradual
2:44:08
decline. The split between the US and Russian controlled blocks had been clear
2:44:13
from the outset. President Harry Truman outlined what is now referred to as the
2:44:18
Truman Doctrine in a March 1947 speech. Every nation must choose between
2:44:25
alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one. One way of
2:44:30
life is based upon the will of the majority and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government,
2:44:37
free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion,
2:44:42
and freedom from political oppression. The second way of life is based upon the
2:44:48
will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and
2:44:53
oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections and the suppression of personal freedoms. I
2:45:01
believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted
2:45:07
subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures. As I explained in chapter 6,
2:45:15
compared to domestic governance, international relations are driven much more by raw power dynamics. That is
2:45:22
because there are laws and standards of behavior within countries. Whereas between them, raw power matters most,
2:45:29
and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed upon treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of
2:45:36
Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much. That is what makes having a strong
2:45:44
military and strong military alliances so important. In 1949, 12 countries in the
2:45:51
US camp with more joining later formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
2:45:57
NATO Military Alliance. And in 1954, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization,
2:46:03
Cedo, was established among the US, the UK, Australia, France, New Zealand, the
2:46:09
Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan. Eight countries in the Soviet
2:46:14
camp formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955. As shown in the next PDF chart, the
2:46:22
Americans and Soviets invested massively in building up their nuclear weapons and a number of other countries followed.
2:46:29
Today, 11 countries have nuclear weapons or are on the brink of having them in varying amounts and degrees of
2:46:37
capability. Having nuclear weapons obviously gives one a big negotiating chip in the world power game. So, it's
2:46:44
understandable why some countries would want to have them and other countries would not want other countries to have
2:46:50
them. While there have been no nuclear wars, the US has fought a number of
2:46:56
conventional wars since World War II. Most notably, the Korean War in the 1950s, the Vietnam War in the 1960s and
2:47:04
1970s, the two Gulf Wars in 1990 and 2003, and the war in Afghanistan from
2:47:10
2001 to 2021. These were costly in terms of money,
2:47:16
lives, and public support for the United States. Were they worth it? That's for
2:47:21
others to decide. For the Soviet Union, which had a much smaller and weaker
2:47:26
economy than the US, spending enough to compete with the US militarily and maintain its empire pushed it into
2:47:35
bankruptcy. See the next PDF titled Nuclear Weapons
2:47:40
Stockpile. Of course, military power consists of a lot more than nuclear weapons, and a lot has changed since the
2:47:47
Cold War. While I'm no military expert, I get to speak to some who have led me
2:47:52
to believe that while the US remains the strongest military power overall, it is
2:47:58
not dominant in all parts of the world in all ways, and military challenges to
2:48:03
it are rising. There is a significant chance that the US would lose wars against China and
2:48:09
Russia in their geographic areas of strength or at least would be unacceptably harmed. And it could also
2:48:16
be unacceptably harmed by some second tier powers too. This is not the good
2:48:21
old days of right after 1945 when the US was the sole dominant power. While there
2:48:28
are a number of high-risk scenarios, in my opinion, the most worrying is a forceful move by China to bring Taiwan
2:48:35
under its control. What will the next highstakes military conflict look like? Because of
2:48:42
new technologies, it will be very different from the previous ones. Classically, the country that wins wars
2:48:49
spends more, invests more, and outlasts the opposition. But it is a delicate
2:48:55
balance because spending on the military takes government money away from spending on social programs and because
2:49:03
military technologies go hand in hand with private sector technologies. The biggest military risk for the leading
2:49:10
powers is that they lose the economic and technology wars. In dealings between countries, the
2:49:17
transactions are more at arms length. That means it is less easy to make the
2:49:22
currency artificially cheap, harming the holders of it. So, internationally traded currencies are more likely to be
2:49:29
better value currencies. This is relevant when currencies are a storehold of wealth in
2:49:35
the form of debt denominated in them. Sometimes there is too much debt around the world and it is in all government's
2:49:42
interest to devalue their currencies. At such times, gold and recently digital
2:49:48
currencies can be preferable. Also, at such times, governments are more likely to outlaw these alternative currencies,
2:49:55
though they can't fully outlaw them. When the money and credit systems based on fiat currencies break down, it
2:50:02
eventually leads to hard money monetary systems. The post-war monetary and
2:50:10
economic systems. As for the new post-war monetary and economic systems, there was
2:50:17
one for the US-led camp and one for the Sovietled camp, though there were also
2:50:23
some non-aligned countries that had their own non-aligned currencies that were not widely
2:50:29
accepted. Representatives of 44 countries gathered in Bretonwoods, New Hampshire in 1944 to make a monetary
2:50:37
system that linked the dollar to gold and other countries currencies to the dollar. The Soviet Union system was
2:50:44
built around the ruble which nobody wanted. Transactions between countries
2:50:50
are very different from transactions within countries. Governments want to control the money that is used within
2:50:56
their borders because by increasing and decreasing its supply, its cost of borrowing and its value, the government
2:51:04
has enormous power. Because money and economics are so important, I want to
2:51:10
return to the subject revisiting how the system works and is working in the
2:51:15
post-war monetary system within countries. People and companies used the government controlled paper money. When
2:51:22
they wanted to buy something from another country, they typically exchanged their own country's paper
2:51:27
currency for the other country's paper currency with the help of their central bank that settled with the other
2:51:33
country's central bank in gold. If they were American, they paid in
2:51:38
dollars and the seller from another country either exchanged them at their central bank for the local currency or
2:51:45
held on to them believing that they were better storeholds of wealth than their own money. The results were that gold
2:51:53
left the US central bank's reserve account and went into the accounts of other countries central bank and dollars
2:52:00
accumulated abroad. As a result of the Bretton Woods Agreement, the dollar became the world's
2:52:06
leading reserve currency. This was natural because the two world wars had made the US the richest and most
2:52:13
powerful country by far. By the end of World War II, the US had amassed its
2:52:18
greatest gold money savings ever. About 2/3 of all the government held gold and
2:52:23
money in the world, the equivalent to 8 years of import purchases. Even after
2:52:29
the war, it continued to earn a lot of money by exporting. The economies of Europe and
2:52:35
Japan had been destroyed by the war. As a solution and to fight the spread of communism, the US supplied them with
2:52:43
massive aid packages known as the Marshall and Dodge plans, which were a
2:52:48
good for these devastated nations, b good for the US economically because
2:52:53
these countries used the money to buy US goods, c good for the US's geopolitical
2:53:00
influence, and d good good for reinforcing the dollar's position as the world's dominant reserve currency.
2:53:08
As for monetary policy, from 1933 until 1951, the amount of money, the cost of
2:53:14
money, that is interest rates, and where that money went was controlled by the Federal Reserve to serve the greater
2:53:21
objectives of the country rather than the free market. While 1933 to 1951 was
2:53:28
the period from the Roosevelt peg break to the monetary accord between the Federal Reserve and Treasury, the policy
2:53:35
of explicit yield curve control in which the Federal Reserve controlled the spread between short-term and long-term
2:53:42
interest rates lasted from 1942 to 1947.
2:53:48
More specifically, the Fed printed a lot of money to buy debt, capped interest rates that lenders could charge, and
2:53:55
controlled what money was allowed to go into. So, high inflation did not drive up interest rates to unacceptable
2:54:02
heights, and government regulations prevented other investment options from becoming much more attractive than the
2:54:08
debt the government wanted people to save in. Following a brief post-war recession that was due to the decline of
2:54:15
military spending, the US entered a prolonged period of peace and prosperity, as is typical when a new big
2:54:23
cycle begins. The postwar recession saw the unemployment rate double to around 4% as
2:54:30
around 20 million people needed to find employment outside of the military and other adjacent jobs. But at the same
2:54:38
time, the removal of rationing laws, which had limited people's ability to buy consumer goods, fueled a consumer
2:54:45
spending surge. Cheap mortgages were also available for veterans, which led
2:54:50
to a housing boom. The return to profit-making activities raised the demand for labor, so employment
2:54:56
rebounded very quickly. Exports were strong because the Marshall and Dodge plans fueled foreign
2:55:03
appetite for US goods. Also, the US private sector went global and invested
2:55:09
abroad from 1945 through the 1970s. Stocks were cheap and dividend
2:55:15
yields were high. The result was a multi-deade bull market that reinforced
2:55:20
New York's dominance as the world's financial center, bringing in still more investment and further strengthening the
2:55:27
dollar as a reserve currency. All of this was classic. It was a mutually
2:55:33
self-reinforcing big cycle upswing. There was enough money for the
2:55:38
US to improve education, invent fabulous technologies, for example, those that
2:55:44
allowed it to go to the moon, and a lot more. The stock market hit its high in
2:55:49
1966, which marked the end of the good times for 16 years, though nobody knew
2:55:55
it then. That was around the time that my own direct contact with events began.
2:56:01
I started investing in 1961 at age 12. Of course, I didn't know what I was
2:56:07
doing and had no appreciation for how lucky my contemporaries and I were. I
2:56:12
was born at the right time and in the right place. The United States was the leading manufacturing country, so labor
2:56:19
was valuable. Most adults could get a good job, and their kids could get a college education and rise without
2:56:26
limitation. Since the majority of people were middle class, the majority of people were
2:56:32
happy. The US did all the classic things that helped the world become more
2:56:37
dollarized. Its banks increased their operations and lending and foreign markets. In 1965, only 13 US banks had
2:56:46
foreign branches. By 1970, 79 banks had them. And by 1980, nearly every major US
2:56:53
bank had at least one foreign branch. and the total number of branches had grown to
2:56:59
787. Global lending boomed. However, as is also typical, A, those who prospered
2:57:06
overdid things by operating financially imprudently, while B, global
2:57:11
competition, especially from Germany and Japan increased. As a result, American
2:57:17
lending and America's finances began to deteriorate as its trade surpluses
2:57:22
disappeared. Americans never thought about how much the space program, the
2:57:28
war on poverty, and the Vietnam War would cost. Because they felt so rich
2:57:33
and the dollar seemed secure as a reserve currency, Americans assumed they could afford a guns and butter fiscal
2:57:40
policy indefinitely. As the 1960s came to a close, real GDP growth was near 0%.
2:57:48
Inflation was around 6%. The short-term government interest rate was around 8%
2:57:54
and unemployment was around 4%. During this decade, US stocks
2:57:59
returned 8% on an annual basis while bonds trailed with equity volatility
2:58:05
matched bonds returning -3% annually. The official gold price remained fixed
2:58:12
in dollar terms with some modest market price appreciation later in the decade
2:58:17
and commodities continued to be weak returning 1%
2:58:23
annually. The 1970s the balance of payments problem unfolds low growth high
2:58:31
inflation. As explained in chapter 3, when claims on hard money, that is notes
2:58:37
or paper money are introduced, at first there is the same number of claims on
2:58:42
the hard money as there is hard money in the bank. However, the holders of the
2:58:47
paper claims and the banks soon discover the wonders of credit and debt. Debt
2:58:53
holders like it because they can lend these paper claims to the bank in exchange for an interest payment, so
2:58:59
they get interest. The banks that borrow it from them like it because they can lend the money to others who pay a
2:59:05
higher interest rate. So the banks make a profit. Those who borrow the money
2:59:10
from the bank like it because it gives them buying power that they didn't have. And the whole society likes it because
2:59:18
asset prices and productivity rise. After 1945, foreign central banks
2:59:25
had the option of holding interest rate paying debt or holding non-interest rate earning gold. Because dollar denominated
2:59:32
debt was considered as good as gold, was convertible to gold, and was higher earning because it provided interest,
2:59:40
central banks shrank their gold holdings relative to their dollar denominated debt holdings from 1945 until
2:59:48
1971. As explained in chapter 4, investors making such a move is a
2:59:53
classic behavior and ends when a the claims on the real money that is gold
2:59:59
substantially exceed the amount of real money in the bank and b one can see that
3:00:05
the amount of real money in the bank that is gold reserves is going down.
3:00:10
That is when no interest rate can be high enough for it to make sense to hold the debt. That is claims on the hard
3:00:16
money rather than to turn one's paper money in for gold. At that time, a run
3:00:22
on the bank occurs and a default and debt restructuring have to happen. That
3:00:28
is what led to the breakdown of the gold linked Bretonwoods monetary system. As inflation accelerated and the
3:00:36
economy weakened in 1969 and 70, the Fed could not afford to maintain a tight
3:00:42
monetary policy. So the US's balance of payments worsened and the dollar took a
3:00:47
nose dive. Rather than running surpluses, the US ran unsustainably huge
3:00:53
balance of payments deficits. That is, the US bought more from the rest of the world than it sold to the rest of the
3:01:00
world. In the summer of 1971, Americans traveling in Europe had
3:01:05
difficulty exchanging their dollars for German marks, French Franks, and British
3:01:11
pounds. The Nixon administration vowed not to devalue the dollar, but in August
3:01:17
1971, the US defaulted on its commitments to pay in gold, offering
3:01:22
paper money instead. Money and credit growth were no longer constrained, and
3:01:27
the decade of stagflation had begun. At the same time, other industrialized
3:01:33
countries had regained their economic strength, becoming very competitive in the world
3:01:39
markets. Rather than seeing these problems as signs of things to come,
3:01:44
Americans viewed them as nothing more than a temporary setback. Yet, as the decade progressed, economic problems
3:01:51
contributed to political problems and vice versa. The Vietnam War and the Watergate affair
3:01:58
dragged on, and there were OPEC induced oil price increases and drought induced
3:02:03
food price hikes. As costs rose, Americans borrowed more in order to
3:02:08
maintain their lifestyles, and the Fed allowed accelerated money supply growth to accommodate the high borrowing and
3:02:15
prevent unacceptably high interest rates. The dollars these deficits produced went
3:02:22
to countries that were running budget surpluses which deposited them in American banks which lent them to Latin
3:02:28
American and other emerging commodity producing countries. Savings and loan
3:02:34
associations borrowed short to make longerterm mortgages and other loans
3:02:39
using the positive spread between short rates which they borrowed at and long rates which they lent at as a source of
3:02:47
profits. Inflation and its effects on markets came in two big waves that were
3:02:53
bracketed by periods of extreme monetary tightness, steep stock market declines,
3:02:58
and deep recessions. Early in the 1970s, most Americans had never experienced
3:03:04
inflation, so they weren't wary of it and allowed it to blossom. By the end of
3:03:09
the decade, they were traumatized by it and assumed that it would never go away. By the end of the 1970s, real GDP
3:03:18
growth was around 2%. Inflation was around 14%. Short-term interest rates were
3:03:25
around 13% and unemployment was around 6%. Over the decade, gold surged and
3:03:32
commodities kept up with rising inflation, returning around 30% and 15%
3:03:38
on an annualized basis, respectively. But the high rate of inflation wiped out
3:03:44
the modest 5% annual nominal return for stocks and 4% return for treasuries
3:03:50
matched to equity volatility. The post Bretonwoods
3:03:57
system. After the 1971 dellinking of the dollar and other currencies from gold,
3:04:04
the world moved to an unanchored fiat monetary system or type 3. As I
3:04:09
explained in chapter 3, and the dollar fell in value against gold, other
3:04:14
currencies, stocks, and eventually just about everything, the new monetary
3:04:20
system was negotiated by the leading economic policy makers of the United States, Germany, and Japan.
3:04:27
If you want to read a great description of this process of figuring out how to go from the old monetary system to the
3:04:33
new fiat one, I recommend Changing Fortunes by Paul Vulkar and
3:04:39
Toyotin. Paul Vulkar was Nixon's under secretary of international monetary affairs when Nixon severed the link with
3:04:47
gold and he was head of the Federal Reserve from 1979 until 1987.
3:04:53
He did more to shape and guide the dollar-based monetary system before, during, and after these years than
3:04:59
anyone. I was lucky enough to know him well, so I can personally attest that he was a person of great character,
3:05:06
capabilities, influence, and humility. A classic hero role model in a world that
3:05:12
lacks hero role models, especially in economic public service. I believe that
3:05:18
he and his thinking deserve to be studied more. I remember the inflation psychology of
3:05:24
that time very well. It led Americans to borrow money and immediately take their
3:05:29
paychecks to buy things to get ahead of inflation. They also bought things that
3:05:34
you couldn't make more of, like gold and waterfront properties. The panic out
3:05:39
ofdoll debt also led interest rates to rise and drove the gold price from the
3:05:45
$35 that it was fixed at in 1944 and officially stayed at until 1971 to $850
3:05:53
in 1980. While most people didn't understand how the money and credit
3:05:58
dynamic worked, they felt the pain of it in the form of high inflation and high
3:06:04
interest rates. So it was a chronic political issue. At the same time, there
3:06:09
was a lot of conflict and rebellion due to the war in Vietnam. Oil embargos that led to high gas prices and gas
3:06:16
rationing, labor union fights with companies over wages and benefits,
3:06:21
Watergate and the Nixon impeachment, etc. These problems peaked in the late
3:06:26
1970s when 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days at the US embassy
3:06:33
in Thran. Americans felt that the country was falling apart. But what most
3:06:39
Americans didn't understand was that economic conditions in communist countries were even
3:06:45
worse. As we'll see in the next chapter, Mao Dongs death in 1976 brought Deng Xiaoping to power in a
3:06:53
China that was stumbling economically and facing internal conflict.
3:06:58
Deng's market reforms led to a shift in economic policies that included capitalist elements like private
3:07:05
ownership of businesses, the development of debt and equities markets, entrepreneurial, technological and
3:07:11
commercial innovations, and even the flourishing of billionaire capitalists, all under the strict control of the
3:07:18
Chinese Communist Party. This shift in leadership and approaches, while seemingly insignificant at the time,
3:07:25
would germinate into the biggest single force to shape the 21st
3:07:32
century. The 1979 to 1982 move to tight money and conservatism.
3:07:40
President Jimmy Carter, who like most political leaders didn't understand the monetary mechanics very well, knew that
3:07:47
something had to be done to stop inflation and appointed a strong monetary policy maker, Vulkar, as head
3:07:54
of the Federal Reserve in August 1979. In October 1979, Vulkar announced
3:08:00
that he would constrain money M1 growth at 5.5%.
3:08:06
I ran the numbers, which led me to figure that if he really did what he said he was going to do, there would be
3:08:12
a great shortage of money that would send interest rates through the roof, bankrupting debtors who could not get
3:08:18
the credit they needed to cover their debt service expenses. Vulkar stuck to the plan
3:08:24
despite great political backlash, driving interest rates to the highest level seen since Jesus Christ, according
3:08:31
to German Chancellor Helmet Schmidt. In the 1980 presidential
3:08:36
election, Carter was voted out and Ronald Reagan, who was perceived as a conservative who would impose discipline
3:08:42
where it was needed, was elected. leading countries at the time reflected
3:08:47
in the G7 which consisted of the US, the UK, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, and
3:08:54
Canada, which shows how different the world power balance was 40 years ago versus today made analogous moves in
3:09:02
electing conservatives to bring discipline to their inflationary chaos. Early in their terms, both Reagan
3:09:09
in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK had landmark fights with labor
3:09:15
unions. Economics and politics have swings between the left and the right in
3:09:21
varying extremes as the excesses of each become intolerable and the memories of
3:09:26
the problems of the other fade. It's like fashion. The widths of
3:09:32
ties and the lengths of skirts change through time. When there is great popularity of one extreme, one should
3:09:38
expect that it won't be too long before there will be a comparable move in the opposite direction. The move to monetary
3:09:45
tightness broke the backs of debtors and curtailed borrowing, which drove the world economy into its worst downturn
3:09:53
since the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve slowly started to cut interest rates, but the markets continued to
3:10:00
decline. Then Mexico defaulted on its debt in August 1982. Interestingly, the US stock market
3:10:08
rallied in response. What happened next created a jarringly painful learning experience
3:10:14
for me. While I was able to anticipate the debt crisis, which was profitable
3:10:20
for me, it also led me a to anticipate a debt default triggered depression that
3:10:26
never came and b to lose a lot of money betting on it. As a result of my
3:10:32
personal losses and the losses of clients, I had to let everyone in my fledgling company, Bridgewater
3:10:38
Associates, go and was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad to help pay my
3:10:44
family's bills. At the same time, this was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it changed my
3:10:51
whole approach to decision-making. What I had missed was that when debts
3:10:56
are in the currencies that central banks have the ability to print and restructure, debt crises can be
3:11:03
well-managed, so they are not systemically threatening. Because the Federal Reserve could provide money to
3:11:09
the banks that made the loans that weren't being paid back, they didn't have a cash flow problem. And because
3:11:16
the American accounting system didn't require the banks to account for these bad debts as losses, there was no big
3:11:23
problem that couldn't be worked out. I learned that the value of assets is the
3:11:28
reciprocal of the value of money and credit. That is, the cheaper money and credit are, the more expensive asset
3:11:35
prices are. And the value of money is the reciprocal of the quantity of it in
3:11:41
existence. So when central banks are producing a lot of money in credit and making it cheaper, it is wise to be more
3:11:48
aggressive in owning assets. The disinflationary and booming
3:11:57
1980s. In the 1980s, there was a stock market and economic boom that was
3:12:02
accompanied by falling inflation and falling interest rates in the United States at the same time as there were
3:12:09
inflationary depressions in the debt burdened emerging economies that didn't have central banks to bail them out. The
3:12:16
debt restructuring process progressed slowly from 1982 until 1989 when an
3:12:22
agreement called the Brady plan named after Nicholas Brady who was the US Treasury Secretary at the time was
3:12:29
created and started to bring an end to the lost decade in these countries as agreements were reached with different
3:12:36
countries through the early9s. This whole 1971 to91 up and
3:12:42
down debt cycle which profoundly affected just about everyone in the world was the result of the US going off
3:12:48
the gold standard. The inflation that followed it and having to break the back of the inflation through tight monetary
3:12:55
policies that led to the strength in the dollar and the dramatic fall in inflation in the markets. That big cycle
3:13:03
showed up via A the soaring of inflation and inflation hedge assets and bare
3:13:08
markets in bonds in the 1970s. B the 1979 to81 bone crushing
3:13:16
monetary tightening that made cash the best investment and led to a lot of deflationary debt restructuring by
3:13:23
non-American debtors. and then C falling inflation rates and excellent
3:13:28
performance of bonds, stocks, and other disinflationary assets in the
3:13:33
1980s. The next PDF charts convey this very well as they show the swings up and
3:13:39
down in dollar denominated inflation rates and interest rates from 1945 to
3:13:45
the present. One needs to keep these moves and the mechanics behind them in mind when thinking about the future.
3:13:54
Through it all, the dollar remained the world's leading reserve currency. The entire period was a forceful
3:14:00
demonstration of the benefits to the US of having the currency that most of the world's debts are denominated
3:14:09
in. 1990 to 2008, globalizing, digitalizing, and booming financed by
3:14:17
debt. Because of its economic failures, the Soviet Union could not afford to
3:14:22
support a its empire, b its economy, and c its military in the face of Reagan's
3:14:29
arms race spending. As a result, the Soviet Union broke down in
3:14:35
1991. It was apparent that communism had failed or was failing everywhere. So
3:14:40
many countries moved away from it and the world entered a very prosperous period of globalization and free market
3:14:48
capitalism. Since then, three economic cycles have brought us to where we are at the time of my writing. One that
3:14:55
peaked in the 2000.com bubble that led to the recession that followed. One that
3:15:01
peaked in the 2007 bubble that led to the 2008 global financial crisis and one
3:15:07
that peaked in 2019 just before the 2020 corona virus triggered
3:15:13
downturn. In addition to the decline of the Soviet Union, this period also saw
3:15:18
the rise of China, globalization, and advances in technologies that replaced
3:15:23
people, which was good for corporate profits, but widened wealth and opportunity
3:15:29
gaps. Countries and their borders faded in importance. Goods and the incomes
3:15:35
they produced were generally made wherever they could be most coste effectively produced which led to
3:15:41
production and development in emerging countries accelerating mobility of people between countries narrowing
3:15:47
wealth gaps between countries and ballooning wealth gaps within them. Lower and middle inome workers in
3:15:54
developed countries suffered while workers in productive emerging countries saw big relative gains. Though a bit of
3:16:02
an oversimplification, it's accurate to say that this was a period in which workers in other countries, especially
3:16:08
those in China, and machines, replaced middlecl class workers in the United
3:16:14
States. The next PDF chart shows the balances of goods and services for the
3:16:19
United States and China since 1990 in real that is inflationadjusted dollars.
3:16:26
This measures whether the country as a whole is spending more than it's earning.
3:16:31
As you will see when we look at China in the next chapter, China's economic reforms and open door policies after
3:16:38
Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978 and China's being welcomed into the World
3:16:44
Trade Organization in 2001 led to an explosion of Chinese competitiveness and
3:16:49
exports. Note the accelerations in Chinese surpluses and the US deficits from
3:16:56
around 2000 to around 2010 and then some narrowing of these differences which
3:17:01
have recently ticked up during the pandemic with China still tending to run surpluses and the US still running
3:17:09
deficits. These surpluses have given China big savings that are a great financial power.
3:17:16
See the next PDF graph titled Exports of Goods and Services Minus Imports of
3:17:22
Goods and Services. Most people pay attention to what they get and not where the money
3:17:29
comes from to pay for it. So, there are strong motivations for elected officials to spend a lot of borrowed money and
3:17:36
make a lot of promises to give voters what they want and to take on debt and
3:17:41
non-debt liabilities that cause problems down the road. That was certainly the case in the 1990
3:17:48
to 2008 period. Throughout the long-term debt cycle from 1945 until 2008, whenever the
3:17:57
Federal Reserve wanted the economy to pick up, it would lower interest rates and make money and credit more
3:18:03
available, which would increase stock and bond prices and increase demand.
3:18:08
That was how it was done until 2008. that is interest rates were cut and
3:18:13
debts were increased faster than incomes to create unsustainable bubbles. That
3:18:19
changed when the bubble burst in 2008 and interest rates hit 0% for the first
3:18:24
time since the Great Depression. As explained more comprehensively in my book, Principles for Navigating Big Debt
3:18:32
Crisis, there are three types of monetary policy. One, interest
3:18:37
ratedriven monetary policy, which I call monetary policy one because it is the
3:18:42
first to be used and is the preferable way to run monetary policy. Two, printing money and buying
3:18:49
financial assets, most importantly, bonds, which I call monetary policy 2,
3:18:55
and is now popularly called quantitative easing. and three coordination between
3:19:02
fiscal policy and monetary policy in which the central government does a lot of debt financed spending and the
3:19:08
central bank buys that debt which I call monetary policy 3 because it is the
3:19:14
third and last approach to be used when the first two cease to be effective. The
3:19:19
next PDF charts show how the debt crises of 1933 and 2008 both led to interest
3:19:26
rates hitting 0% and were followed by big money printing by the Federal
3:19:32
Reserve. This change in monetary policy had big effects and
3:19:39
implications. The 2008 to 2020 money financed capitalist
3:19:45
boom. In 2008, the debt crisis led to interest rates being lowered until they
3:19:51
hit 0%, which led the three main reserve currency central banks, led by the Fed,
3:19:57
to move from an interest rate driven monetary policy to a monetary policy of printing money and buying financial
3:20:04
assets. Central banks printed money and bought financial assets which put money
3:20:09
in the hands of investors who bought other financial assets which caused financial asset prices to rise which was
3:20:17
helpful for the economy and particularly beneficial to those who were rich enough to own financial assets. So it increased
3:20:24
the wealth gap. Basically borrowed money was essentially free. So investment
3:20:30
borrowers and corporate borrowers took advantage of this to get it and used it to make purchases that drove stock
3:20:36
prices and corporate profits up. This money did not trickle down proportionately. So wealth and income
3:20:44
gaps continued to grow. Wealth and income gaps grew to the largest since
3:20:49
the 1930 to 45 period as shown in the next two PDF charts.
3:20:56
In 2016, Donald Trump, a blunt-speaking businessman and capitalist populist of
3:21:02
the right, led a revolt against establishment politicians and elites to
3:21:07
get elected president by promising to support people with conservative values
3:21:12
who had lost jobs and were struggling. He went on to cut corporate taxes and
3:21:18
run big budget deficits that the Fed accommodated. While this debt growth financed relatively strong market
3:21:24
economy growth and created some improvements for lower income earners, it was accompanied by a further widening
3:21:31
of the wealth and values gap leading the have nots to become increasingly resentful of the halves. At the same
3:21:39
time, the political gap grew with increasingly extreme Republicans on the one side and increasingly extreme
3:21:46
Democrats on the other. This is reflected in the next two PDF charts
3:21:51
titled ideological positions of the major parties and share of congressional
3:21:56
members votes cast along party lines. The first one shows how conservative
3:22:02
Republicans in the Senate and House and how liberal Democrats in the Senate and House have become relative to the past.
3:22:10
Based on this measure, they have become more extreme and their divergence has become larger than ever before. While
3:22:17
I'm not sure that's exactly right, I think it's by and large right. The next PDF chart shows the
3:22:25
percentage of votes along party lines for the average representative, which is the highest ever. This continues to be
3:22:33
reflected in the reduced willingness to cross party lines to compromise and reach agreements. In other words, the
3:22:40
political splits in the country have become deep and intrigent.
3:22:45
Trump took a more aggressive negotiating posture concerning economic and geopolitical disagreements with
3:22:52
international rivals, particularly China and Iran, and allies such as Europe and
3:22:58
Japan regarding trade and paying for military expenditures. The conflicts with China
3:23:04
over trade, technology, geopolitics, and capital were intensifying as his term
3:23:10
ended in 2021. Economic sanctions such as those that were used in the 1930 to45 period were
3:23:18
being used or put on the table for possible use. In March 2020, the Corona virus
3:23:25
pandemic hit and incomes, employment, and economic activity plunged as the
3:23:30
country and much of the world went into lockdown. The US government took on a
3:23:36
lot of debt to give people and companies a lot of money and the Federal Reserve printed a lot of money and bought a lot
3:23:43
of debt. So did other central banks. As a reflection of this, the next PDF
3:23:49
charts show the unemployment rates and central bank balance sheets of major countries for as far back as data is
3:23:56
available. As shown, all the levels of central banks printing of money and
3:24:01
buying of financial assets rose to near or beyond the previous record amounts in
3:24:07
the war years. As history has shown and as explained in chapter 4, when there is a
3:24:14
great increase in money and credit, it drives down the value of money and credit, which drives up the value of
3:24:21
other investment assets. The printing and buying of debt that the Fed undertook in 2020 was much like
3:24:28
Roosevelt's March 1933 move, Nixon's August 1971 move, Vulkar's August 1982
3:24:36

3:24:44
It has become standard operating procedure for central banks, and it will persist until it no longer works.
3:24:53
where the US is now in its big cycle. The stats in my model suggest
3:25:00
that the US is roughly 70% through its big cycle, plus or minus
3:25:05
10%. The United States has not yet crossed the line into the sixth phase of
3:25:11
a civil war revolution when the active fighting begins, but internal conflict
3:25:16
is high and rising. The recent elections show how split the country is almost
3:25:22
50/50 along seemingly irreconcilable lines. The next PDF graphic represents
3:25:29
what the population looked like 50 years ago. That is the majority of each party
3:25:34
were moderates and the extremists were less extreme. Now it looks as shown in the
3:25:41
next PDF. That is with a greater concentration and number of people at
3:25:46
the extremes. History has shown us that greater polarization equals either a greater
3:25:53
risk of political gridlock which reduces the chances of revolutionary changes that rectify the problems or b some form
3:26:02
of civil war revolution. In chapter 5, I described the classic markers signaling the
3:26:09
probabilities of escalation from stage 5 to stage six. The three most important
3:26:15
markers I am watching now are one the rules being
3:26:20
disregarded, two both sides emotionally attacking each other, and three blood
3:26:26
being spilled. In the final chapter of this book, I will share the quantitative
3:26:32
measures that I use to track how things are going. I will continue to watch these and share what I'm seeing with you
3:26:39
at economicprinciples.org. But first, we will look at a rising
3:26:45
world power, China, and the ways in which it is coming into conflict with the
3:26:51
US. Chapter 12. The big cycle rise of China and the Renman

3:26:58
B. Emotions have been running so high between the US and China that many
3:27:03
people have urged me not to publish this chapter. We are in a kind of war, they
3:27:09
say. Any complimentary things you write about China will alienate US readers
3:27:14
while criticism of China will infuriate the Chinese and the media will make things worse by distorting everything
3:27:20
you say. That's probably true, but I can't not speak openly because the US
3:27:26
China relationship is too important to be left unmentioned by anyone who knows both countries as well as I do. To not
3:27:34
speak honestly would cost me my selfrespect. I'm not afraid of criticism. I welcome
3:27:40
it. What I'm passing along here is just the latest iteration of my learning process, which is to develop my
3:27:47
perspectives through direct experiences and research. To write up what I learn, to stress test it by showing it to smart
3:27:54
people, to explore our differences if and when we have them, to evolve my
3:27:59
thinking some more, and to do that over and over again until I die. While this
3:28:04
study reflects nearly 40 years of doing just that with China, it is still incomplete. It is right and wrong in
3:28:12
ways that have yet to be discovered, and it is provided to you to use or criticize in the spirit of finding out
3:28:18
what's true. This chapter is focused on China and Chinese history. The following
3:28:25
chapter is on US China relations. What I hope to provide in this chapter is a
3:28:31
better understanding of where the Chinese are coming from, of how they see us and themselves as a result of having
3:28:37
lived through their history. While I'm not a scholar of Chinese culture and the Chinese way of operating, I believe that
3:28:44
my numerous direct encounters with China, my historical and economic research, and my US and global
3:28:50
perspective give me a unique sense of its past and present. After you listen to this, you can decide for yourself
3:28:57
whether or not that's true. China's culture, by which I mean its people's innate expectations about
3:29:04
how families and communities should behave with each other and how leaders should lead and followers should follow,
3:29:11
evolved over thousands of years through the rises and falls of its many ruling dynasties and the development of
3:29:18
Confucian and Neo Confucian philosophy, as well as other beliefs. I've seen
3:29:23
these typical Chinese values and ways of operating manifested over and over
3:29:28
again. For example, in the economic and leadership approaches of two men, Lie
3:29:34
Kuan Yu, the former longtime prime minister of Singapore and Deng Xiaoing,
3:29:39
who initiated China's reform and opening up. Both combined Confucian values with
3:29:45
capitalist practices. in Deng's case, creating a socialist market economy with
3:29:50
Chinese characteristics. Over the last couple of years, as part of my study of the rises
3:29:57
and declines of empires and their currencies, I have also undertaken a study of Chinese history to help me
3:30:03
understand how the Chinese think, especially their leaders who are greatly influenced by history. I began my
3:30:10
research with the year 600, just before the Tang Dynasty. The entire report on
3:30:16
China's dynasties is available at economicprinciples.org. While I can be
3:30:21
pretty certain about my impressions of the people and things that I have had direct contact with, I of course can't
3:30:27
be as certain about those I haven't. My thoughts about historical figures such as Mao Dong are based on facts gathered,
3:30:35
experts thinking gathered from conversations and books and conjecture.
3:30:40
What I can say is that between my own experience, the efforts of my research team, and my extensive triangulation
3:30:47
with some of the most knowledgeable China scholars and practitioners on the planet, I have a high degree of
3:30:53
confidence in my conclusions. Since my first trip to China in 1984, I have come to know many
3:31:00
Chinese from the lowest to the highest in rank in an uplose personal way. and I
3:31:06
have experienced their recent history as directly as I have experienced Americas. As a result, I believe that I
3:31:12
understand both the American and Chinese perspectives pretty well. I urge those
3:31:18
of you who haven't spent considerable time in China to look past the caricatured pictures that are often
3:31:24
painted by biased parties and rid yourself of any stereotypes you might have that are based on what you thought
3:31:30
you knew about the old communist China because they're wrong. Triangulate
3:31:36
whatever you are hearing or reading with people who have spent a lot of time in China working with the Chinese people.
3:31:42
As an aside, I think the widespread media distortions and the blind and near
3:31:47
violent loyalties that stand in the way of the thoughtful exploration of our different perspectives are a frightening
3:31:54
sign of our times. To be clear, I'm not ideological.
3:31:59
I don't choose a side on an issue based on whether it aligns with American, Chinese, or my own personal beliefs. I'm
3:32:07
practical. I approach things like a doctor who relies on logic and cause effect relationships and believes in
3:32:14
what works well through time. The only thing I can do is beg for your patience
3:32:19
and open-mindedness. As I share what I've learned with you, I laid out the factors that I
3:32:26
believe are most important to a country's health. When I discussed the 18 determinants at the beginning of this
3:32:32
book, of those I highlighted eight measures of power. Education,
3:32:37
competitiveness, innovation, technology, trade, economic output, military,
3:32:43
financial center status, and reserve currency status. When I judge China's
3:32:48
strengths and weaknesses, it is through the lens of those factors. I also try to
3:32:53
understand China's circumstances as the Chinese themselves do through their
3:32:59
eyes. To refresh your memory, the next chart shows the relative standing of the
3:33:04
world's leading countries as measured in indices that measure eight different types of power. In examining the rises
3:33:11
and declines of the great empire since 1500, I looked at each of these measures. I will now do the same for
3:33:18
China, briefly conveying the long arc of its history while diving into its highlights in a more granular
3:33:25
way. Breaking this rise down further, the next chart shows the eight measures
3:33:31
of power for China between 1800 and the present. Unlike the cycles for the Dutch,
3:33:37
British, and American empires, which began with their rises and were followed by their protracted declines, China's
3:33:45
cycle over the past 200 years was a long decline followed by a rapid rise. Though
3:33:51
the order is reversed, the same forces drove the cycle. Seven of the eight powers hit their lowest points in the
3:33:58
1940 to50 period. Since then, most of them, notably economic competitiveness,
3:34:04
education, and military power, improved gradually until around 1980 when China's
3:34:10
economic competitiveness and trade took off. That was right after Deng
3:34:15
Xiaoping's open door and reform policies began. That is no coincidence. From my
3:34:21
first visit to China in 1984 until about 2008, debt growth was in line with
3:34:27
economic growth, which was very strong. In other words, extremely rapid
3:34:32
improvements were made without loading the economy up with debt. Then the 2008
3:34:38
financial crisis came along and China, like the rest of the world, used a lot of debt to stimulate its economy. So
3:34:45
debts rose relative to incomes. When Xiinping came to power in 2012, he
3:34:51
improved China's debt and economic management dramatically, continued growth in innovation and technologies,
3:34:58
strengthened education and the military, and encountered greater conflict with the US. China is now roughly tied with
3:35:06
the US in being the leading power in trade, economic output, and innovation and technology. And it is a strong and
3:35:13
quickly rising military and educational power. It is an emerging power in the
3:35:18
financial sector but is lagging as a reserve currency and financial center.
3:35:24
We will explore all of this in more detail later in the chapter. But in order to understand China's present, we
3:35:30
first need to wade into its tremendous history. China's giant history in a tiny
3:35:38
nutshell. Anyone who wants to have a fundamental understanding of China needs to know the
3:35:45
basics of its history, the many patterns that repeat within it, and the timeless and universal principles that its
3:35:51
leaders have gained from studying those patterns. Getting even a basic understanding of Chinese history is a
3:35:58
considerable undertaking, spanning some 4,000 years. It is so vast and
3:36:03
complicated and has inspired so many different and sometimes contradictory interpretations that I am confident that
3:36:10
there is no single source of truth. And I am especially confident that I'm not it. Still, there is a lot that
3:36:17
knowledgeable people agree on. And many scholars and practitioners, both Chinese and non-Chinese, have shared valuable
3:36:24
insights with me. Trying to piece together all that I have learned has not only been a valuable experience for me,
3:36:31
but also a fascinating one. While I can't guarantee that my perspectives are
3:36:36
the best, I can guarantee that they have been well triangulated with some of the most informed people in the
3:36:43
world. China's civilization began around 2000 B.CE with the Sha dynasty, which
3:36:50
lasted about 400 years and is credited with bringing the Bronze Age to Asia.
3:36:55
Confucious, who developed the philosophy that most influences how the Chinese behave with each other to this day,
3:37:02
lived from 551 to 479 B.CE. TheQin Dynasty united most of the
3:37:09
geographic area that we now call China around 221 B.CE. and was followed by the
3:37:15
400year Han Dynasty, which pioneered governance systems that are still in use. The Tang dynasty came to the 4 in
3:37:24
618 CE. The next chart applies to China. The
3:37:29
same overall power gauge that I showed you in the chart of great empires covering the more than 1,400 years
3:37:36
between 600 and today. With the notable exception of the period from around 1840
3:37:42
to 1950 when it experienced a steep decline, China has historically stood
3:37:47
among the most powerful empires in the world. As it emerged from civil war, it began to rise again. At first, slowly
3:37:55
and then very rapidly. Today, it is second only to the US and is poised to
3:38:00
surpass it. Most of the dynasties that ruled China over the course of this time span
3:38:07
were as cultured as they were powerful. I only named the most prominent in the chart. There were many others. Each of
3:38:14
these dynasties has its own fascinating story, but to do those stories justice would take far more space than can fit
3:38:21
in this chapter. The Tang Dynasty 618 to 9007 is
3:38:28
considered by many Chinese to be a high point of imperial China. The Tang came
3:38:33
to power after a prolonged period of disunion and civil war which had culminated in China being reunified by
3:38:40
the short-lived Sui dynasty which immediately preceded the Tang. The
3:38:46
dynasty was established by a father-son pair of strong leaders with the son the
3:38:51
Tangs second emperor Taong being especially notable. They not only
3:38:56
militarily unified China, but also established a stable government system and policies that were highly effective,
3:39:04
producing quality education, excellent development of technologies, international trade, and diverse
3:39:10
ideas. Taong was a great revolutionary leader who was able to consolidate
3:39:15
power, build a great dynasty, and transition well so that the dynasty remained strong without him. A period of
3:39:23
great prosperity lasted about 150 years with a particularly strong military that
3:39:28
helped the Tang control valuable trade routes in Central Asia. By the late
3:39:34
700s, however, the Tang slipped into decline for the classic reasons.
3:39:39
Equality of governance fell. Fragmentation over economic and values gaps led to a weakened and corrupt
3:39:45
central government, which combined with internal conflict led to a series of rebellions. Its finances deteriorated
3:39:53
and natural disasters increased in impact. Then came the northern and
3:39:59
southern Song dynasties 960 to 1279 during which China was the most
3:40:05
innovative and dynamic economy in the world. The deterioration of the Tang
3:40:10
dynasty led to its own period of civil war and disunion in the 900s. Out of
3:40:16
this conflict, the Song dynasty came to power under the rule of Emperor Taihu in
3:40:22
960. Taihu was one of those classic strong revolutionary leaders who needed
3:40:27
to and could bring order to chaos. He successfully rose to power as a military
3:40:33
leader and when in power implemented widespread reforms to A bring together
3:40:38
the different factions that had previously fought for power, b create a centralized top-down system of military
3:40:45
and civilian governance and c expand education and the quality of governance
3:40:51
particularly through reforming the imperial examination system. These investments in education and meritocracy
3:40:58
under Taihu and his successors set the Song Dynasty on the classic good path
3:41:03
that led to immense scientific and technological advancement. Among the many inventions
3:41:09
of the Song Dynasty were the movable type printing press, a compass for navigation and paper currency.
3:41:17
However, after a few generations around the year 1100, the dynasty declined due
3:41:23
to a combination of weak leadership, financial problems, and other classic
3:41:28
factors. In its weakened state, it became vulnerable to external powers.
3:41:33
During the 1100s and 1200s, the Song first lost control of the northern half
3:41:38
of China. Then after a revival period known as the southern song dynasty were
3:41:44
conquered by Mongol leader Kubla Khan. Kublakhan founded the
3:41:49
comparatively short-lived Yuan dynasty 1279 to 1368. For much of his rule, Kublakhan
3:41:57
governed well and behaved like a classic dynastic founder. He encouraged education, unified the state, and
3:42:04
relative to many other Mongol leaders, stood out for his meritocratic and open-minded style of governing. Under
3:42:12
Kublakhan, China's economy and trade strengthened after a long period of conflict. At the same time, the Yuan
3:42:19
pursued expensive wars of conquest. Corruption grew later in his rule, and
3:42:25
the failure to establish a stable succession structure led to frequent civil wars and crises. after his death.
3:42:33
This corruption and instability helped produce rebellions that ended the dynasty after less than a
3:42:40
century. The Ming dynasty 1368 to 1644 presided over an empire that was
3:42:48
largely prosperous and peaceful. It was founded by the Hong Wu Emperor who was
3:42:53
born into poverty and rose to be a great general who captured Beijing and threw
3:42:58
out the Mongol rulers. He consolidated power in a 14-year purge that led to
3:43:04
about 30,000 executions. After winning power through a successful rebellion against the
3:43:10
unpopular Yuan dynasty, early Ming leaders built a meritocratic society with excellent education and civil
3:43:17
behavior that fostered innovation. Over time, the Ming dynasty expanded trade with Europe as Chinese
3:43:24
goods were of superior quality, which brought in enormous amounts of silver and redirected the nation's energies
3:43:31
from subsistence agriculture to industry. However, the Ming's failure to manage
3:43:37
monetary and fiscal policy well, to consistently support China's influence
3:43:42
over international trade, and to adequately respond to a series of crises, left China exposed and
3:43:49
vulnerable. To make matters worse, the little ice age led to agricultural
3:43:54
disaster and famine. In the end, war, famine, and ecological
3:44:00
disaster combined with a rigid and ineffectual state created an unreoverable catastrophe that led to the
3:44:07
collapse of the nearly three centuries old Ming dynasty by
3:44:13
1644. TheQing dynasty 1644 to 1912 came
3:44:18
to power when the neighboring Manchu people capitalized on instability and rebellions in Ming China to challenge
3:44:25
it. This culminated in the sacking of Beijing by rebels during which the last
3:44:30
Ming emperor committed suicide. Then the cycle began again under theQing
3:44:36
dynasty. China achieved its maximum territorial expansion governing over a
3:44:41
third of the world's population. While reforms under the reigns of three longruling emperors led to an extended
3:44:48
period of economic prosperity. China's share of world GDP rose to 30%
3:44:55
and the population more than doubled during the 1700s. Then the European powers
3:45:01
arrived. Earlier in this book, we saw how the European powers in the age of
3:45:07
exploration used their military strength to trade with and exploit resourcerich
3:45:12
but militarily weaker foreigners. That's what happened starting in the early
3:45:17
1800s, which began what is called the century of humiliation in China. The
3:45:23
Europeans came offering to trade, but the Chinese didn't want anything they had to offer. This led to the British
3:45:30
bringing opium into China to get the Chinese addicted so that they would trade for it. A series of military
3:45:37
confrontations followed during the 1800s, most notably the Opium Wars,
3:45:42
which sped China's decline. Chinese moves to stem their decline failed, and there was great
3:45:49
internal conflict and uprisings, most notably the Taiping Rebellion, which
3:45:54
continued until the collapse of theQing dynasty in 1912.
3:45:59
The lessons this history provides remain very much in the forefront of the minds of China's current leaders and are
3:46:06
fascinating to me especially in the context of the patterns of [Music]
3:46:12
history. How the typical dynastic cycle transpires. The typical major Chinese
3:46:19
dynasty, like the typical empire, lasted about 250 years, give or take 150 years,
3:46:26
and by and large followed the same pattern of rises and declines. To clarify, most dynasties were minor,
3:46:33
short-lived dynasties or regional dynasties that swiftly rose and fell during periods of instability in China.
3:46:41
Different sources give different numbers for the total number of dynasties because it's not even clear what
3:46:46
constituted a minor or regional dynasty versus some other form of
3:46:52
administration. Concerning the major dynasties, there were roughly nine that unified China and often ruled for
3:46:58
extended periods. This group includes the five our case study focuses on from
3:47:03
600 to the present. the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, andQing, and four from the
3:47:10
800 years prior. The Chin, Han, Xin, and Sui. You can especially see the internal
3:47:18
order cycle described in chapter 5 at play time and time again. as a reminder
3:47:24
of that cycle. Stage one, when the new order begins and the new leadership consolidates power,
3:47:31
which leads to Stage two, when the resource allocation systems and
3:47:36
government bureaucracies are built and refined, which if done well, leads to stage three, when there is peace and
3:47:44
prosperity, which leads to stage four, when there are great excesses in spending and debt, and the widening of
3:47:51
wealth and political gaps, which leads to stage five, when there are very bad financial conditions and intense
3:47:58
conflict which leads to stage six when there are civil wars, revolutions which
3:48:04
leads to stage 1 which leads to stage two etc. with the whole cycle happening
3:48:09
over again. Let's review this cycle quickly.
3:48:14
The typical cycle begins with strong leaders who win control and implement improvements needed to build a great
3:48:20
empire. As with most other empires, the initial winning of the war for control
3:48:26
is typically followed by struggling to get most of the population in line and united, often through conflict to
3:48:32
establish the leadership's power. That is typically followed by a peace that is
3:48:37
due to no entities wanting to challenge the dominant power. Stage one. Then the new ruler turns to
3:48:45
building up the empire. To be successful, an empire needs a smart and determined population that works well
3:48:51
with each other. It also needs to be strong financially. These things are obtained by systems that train and
3:48:58
produce people who have strong education and selfdiscipline. Getting the most capable
3:49:04
people into the most important roles requires the meritocratic selection of people. In Chinese dynasties, the
3:49:11
imperial exams often played that role and it was common for new dynasties to implement educational
3:49:18
reforms. It also requires an effective resource allocation system. Stage
3:49:24
two. During that period of peace and rising power, the empire typically works
3:49:29
well economically and improves its financial condition. While the empire typically starts with limited financial
3:49:36
resources and low debts because the previous empire's debts have been wiped out, in some cases it has assets that
3:49:44
were acquired as an outcome of the prior war that it won. In the case of Chinese
3:49:49
history, key variables were the distribution of land ownership and taxation of it. Often the arrival of a
3:49:56
new dynasty weakened or overturned the corrupt elites of the prior system, vastly improving the resources available
3:50:04
to the state. With these resources, the dynasty profits and expands. It builds
3:50:09
commercial, technological, and military strengths that reinforce each other. For
3:50:14
example, having strong technologies helps the dynasty economically and militarily because they can be used for
3:50:21
both purposes and because being strong militarily protects the country's commercial interests, for example,
3:50:27
protects trade routes, which also strengthens the dynasty financially. At its peak, the dynasty's
3:50:34
government is functioning well. Its resources and people are employed productively, and prior investments are
3:50:41
yielding new gains. The economy is strong and self- sustaining and the people are prosperous and produce great
3:50:48
achievements in scholarship, the arts, trade, architecture, and other elements of great
3:50:53
civilizations. Stage three, the decline of the empire
3:50:59
typically happens because the forces that strengthened it fade and a rival power emerges. Leadership weakens, often
3:51:07
becomes corrupt and/or allows corruption in others. Typically, the bad emperors
3:51:13
were distant from managing the affairs of the empire and tolerated or even participated in corruption while
3:51:20
ignoring public investment needs. Several were known for greater ideological rigidity, for their poor
3:51:27
judgment and the poor judgment of their top adviserss, and for being preoccupied
3:51:32
with the luxuries that their positions afforded them. The last emperors of most
3:51:37
dynasties often came after the dynasty was already weakened and often had limited control or even involvement in
3:51:44
political events. For example, child emperors. Also, the dynasty typically
3:51:51
becomes overextended and quite often becomes heavily indebted, which causes it to have debt problems that are
3:51:57
typically dealt with by printing lots of money, which in turn devalues the money.
3:52:03
The dynasty's population also becomes increasingly fragmented and loses its unity of purpose and ability to work
3:52:10
well together. The wealth gap increases which undermines productivity and leads
3:52:15
to political conflict. Often there is some form of natural disaster, frequently a drought or a flood that
3:52:22
exacerbates the dynasty's problems. The more of these that happen at the same time, the greater the chance that the
3:52:29
dynasty will fall. The fall itself comes with escalating rebellions and then a bloody
3:52:36
civil war. Stage five and stage six. Eventually, a strong new leader emerges,
3:52:41
wins the conflict, and begins the cycle again with a new dynasty. Stage one.
3:52:47
Again, there are common themes in the decline of the different dynasties. Themes also visible in the decline of
3:52:54
some of the other powers mentioned in this book. One, growing inequality and fiscal
3:53:01
problems over the course of the dynasty are critical drivers of the decline. Dynasties often started with
3:53:08
more equal land and wealth holdings as the concentrated holdings of the old dynasty's elites were redistributed
3:53:15
which helped with preventing social conflict and helped the fiscal position because elites often were more able to
3:53:22
shelter themselves from taxes than the broader base of small landholders.
3:53:27
But over the years, land became concentrated in fewer and fewer families who could evade taxes via bribery, using
3:53:34
official influence, and finding other ways to hide and shelter their wealth from taxation, which in turn allowed
3:53:41
them to build their wealth further. The inequality this produced helped directly
3:53:47
spawn conflict, and the weakening tax base of the state made the state weaker
3:53:52
and more vulnerable to crisis. Two, monetary problems were common
3:53:58
contributors to the decline of the empires. In the Song, Yuan, and Ming
3:54:04
dynasties, the government struggled to maintain a large enough money supply in metal coins and resorted to money
3:54:10
printing, especially in times of war and natural or humancaused disaster. The
3:54:17
problems with collecting taxes made the incentive to print even stronger. This
3:54:22
caused high inflation or hyperinflation making matters worse. Three, the quality of governance
3:54:30
and infrastructure tended to rise early in each dynasty and then fall over the
3:54:36
course of the dynasty. Later in the Song, Ming, andQing dynasties, years of
3:54:41
underinvestment in public works built up, leaving China vulnerable to famines and floods. And while it's hard to
3:54:49
generalize over dozens of emperors, the visionary founder of the dynasty, for
3:54:54
example, the founders of the Song and Yuan dynasties who embraced technology and science, was typically succeeded by
3:55:01
rulers who were more rigid and conservative, for example, in theQing dynasty. too focused on imperial riches
3:55:08
and luxuries, for example, the last rulers of the northern Song Dynasty and
3:55:13
or less supportive of foreign trade in the Ming dynasty.
3:55:20
Four, internal conflict usually arose from economic differences combined with
3:55:25
bad times, most typically caused by agricultural problems, high debts, poor
3:55:31
governance, and natural disasters, and sometimes by conflicts with outside
3:55:36
forces. Significant natural disasters and periods of quick climate change that
3:55:41
were painfully disruptive often coincided with the fall of dynasties. The classic downward spiral has been
3:55:48
that one, inadequate technology and investment, both new projects and
3:55:54
maintenance, leaves infrastructure susceptible to natural disasters. Two, a disaster hits, in
3:56:01
China's case, this was typically via droughts and flooding from the major rivers, which damages crop yields and in
3:56:08
some cases destroys communities as lower crop yields lead to food scarcity and
3:56:13
famine. and three domestic populist uprisings result from the
3:56:19
disasters. This process played a significant role in the declines of the Song, Yuan, Ming, andQing
3:56:27
dynasties. Five bad conditions and large wealth gaps led to the most significant
3:56:33
uprisings which were due to the common man rebelling against the excesses of the elite. For example, the Fang La
3:56:40
rebellion in the Song Dynasty, the Red Turban Rebellion in the Yuan dynasty,
3:56:45
and the White Lotus Rebellion in theQing dynasty. Conversely, domestic stability
3:56:51
arising from good conditions for most people was a key characteristic of the more prosperous periods.
3:57:00
Six isolation and Confucian cultural influences that favored scholarship over
3:57:06
commerce, technology, and military strength led to China's weaker competitiveness in business, technology,
3:57:13
and the military, which led it to be beaten by or fall behind stronger
3:57:18
barbarians. For example, the Mongols, the foreign powers in the opium wars,
3:57:23
and the rest of the world in the Mao isolation period.
3:57:28
China's physical geography and geology have also had a big impact on the rise
3:57:34
and fall of dynasties. The main thing to know is that China's terrain is varied
3:57:39
and often volatile. For example, the north is colder, flatter, and drier, and
3:57:45
the south is more mountainous, much warmer, and wetter, which leads to China's different areas having often
3:57:51
inconsistent crop production. However, a united China is largely self-contained
3:57:57
because the diversification and coordination of the parts make it that way. Still, these conditions, plus
3:58:04
shortages of clean water, crop land, and coastal marine fisheries, have historically made China vulnerable to
3:58:11
food shortages. For that reason, China has often been food insecure and even
3:58:17
today imports a lot of food. China also has shortages of important
3:58:22
natural resources such as oil, some minerals, and some food stuffs. It also
3:58:28
has bad air pollution that adversely affects the health of its people and its agriculture. though it is quickly
3:58:34
improving these conditions. Such events led past and current leaders of China to learn
3:58:41
lessons and establish protections against these natural and political disasters being repeated or leading to
3:58:47
unacceptable consequences. In other words, there are many lessons embedded in these histories
3:58:53
and believe me, all of them influence the decision-making of China's leaders today, whether they are planning for the
3:59:00
long term or dealing with cases at hand. What is especially interesting to me is
3:59:06
seeing how far back in history the patterns of the archetypical big cycle go since China's history is both so
3:59:13
ancient and so well documented. I was also fascinated to see what happened
3:59:18
when the eastern and western worlds interacted more significantly from the 17th through the 19th centuries and how
3:59:26
as the world became much smaller and more interconnected, the Chinese and western big cycles affected each
3:59:33
other. Probably the most important thing I gained from studying the history of so many countries is the ability to see the
3:59:41
big patterns of causes and effects. Shifting my perspective to the very long
3:59:46
term felt like zooming out in Google Maps because it allowed me to see contours that I couldn't see before and
3:59:53
how the same stories play out over and over again for basically the same reasons. I also came to understand how
4:00:00
having so much history to study has affected the Chinese way of thinking which is very different from the
4:00:07
American way of thinking which is much more focused on what is happening now.
4:00:12
Most Americans believe their own history is just 300 or 400 years old since they
4:00:17
believe the country began with European settlement and they aren't terribly interested in learning from
4:00:23
it. Whether they are interested or not, 300 years seems like a very long time
4:00:29
ago to Americans, but for the Chinese it isn't long at all. While the prospect of
4:00:35
a revolution or a war that will overturn the US system is unimaginable to most
4:00:40
Americans, both seem inevitable to the Chinese because they have seen those things happen again and again and have
4:00:47
studied the patterns that inevitably precede them. While most Americans focus on particular events, especially those
4:00:54
that are happening now, most Chinese leaders view current events in the context of larger, more evolutionary
4:01:01
patterns. Americans are impulsive and tactical. They fight for what they want
4:01:07
in the present. Most Chinese are strategic. They plan for how they can
4:01:13
get what they want in the future. I have also found Chinese leaders to be much
4:01:18
more philosophical, literally readers of philosophy, than American leaders. For
4:01:24
example, I had a meeting with a Chinese leader who had just met President Donald Trump and had concerns about the
4:01:30
possibility of a US China conflict. He explained how he approached the meeting,
4:01:36
which struck me as starkly different from how President Trump likely had.
4:01:41
This leader and I have known each other for many years, during which time we have talked mostly about the Chinese and
4:01:47
world economies and markets. Over those years, we have developed a friendship.
4:01:52
He is a very skilled, wise, humble, and likable man. He explained that going
4:01:58
into his meeting with Trump, he was concerned about the worst case scenario where tit fortat escalations could get
4:02:05
out of control and lead to war. He referred to history and gave a personal story of his father to convey his
4:02:12
perspective that wars were so unimaginably harmful and the damage of the next war could be worse than the
4:02:18
last war which had killed more people than any other. He focused on World War
4:02:23
I as an example. He said that to calm himself down and gain equinimity, he
4:02:29
read critique of pure reason by Emanuel Kant and he realized that he could only
4:02:35
do his best and then the outcomes would take their course. I told him about the
4:02:40
serenity prayer and suggested meditation to him. God grant me the serenity to
4:02:46
accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
4:02:54
I went home and read Critique of Pure Reason again, which I found challenging.
4:02:59
I did and still do admire him and value his perspective greatly.
4:03:05
I tell this story to share with you one Chinese leader's perspective on the risk of wars and to also give one example of
4:03:12
the many interactions I've had with this leader and of the many interactions I've had with many Chinese leaders and
4:03:19
Chinese people in order to help you see them through my eyes and through their eyes.
4:03:25
Chinese history and philosophy, most importantly Confucian, Dowist, legalist,
4:03:30
Marxist philosophies, have a much bigger influence on Chinese thinking than
4:03:36
American history and its Judeo-Christian European philosophical roots have on
4:03:41
American thinking. An esteemed Chinese historian told me that Mao read the Mammoth 20 volume
4:03:48
chronicle comprehensive mirror for aid in government which covers the 16
4:03:53
dynasties and 1,400 years of Chinese history from around 400 B.CEE CE to 960
4:04:00
CE and the even more mammoth 24 histories several times as well as
4:04:06
numerous volumes about Chinese history and the writings of non-Chinese philosophers most importantly marks he
4:04:14
also wrote and spoke philosophically wrote poetry and practiced
4:04:19
calligraphy if you interested in what Mao thought or more importantly how he thought I suggest you read on practice
4:04:27
on contradiction and of course the little red book which is a compendium of his quotations on a number of
4:04:34
subjects. I'd like to thank Kevin Rudd, former prime minister of Australia and current president and CEO of the Asia
4:04:42
Society Policy Institute for pointing me to these books and helping me understand Chinese politics.
4:04:49
The planning horizon that Chinese leaders concern themselves with is well over a century because that's at least
4:04:56
how long a good dynasty lasts. They understand that the typical arc of
4:05:02
development has different multi-deade phases in it which they plan for. The
4:05:07
first phase of the current Chinese empire occurred under Mao when the revolution took place. Control of the
4:05:14
country was won and power and institutions were solidified. The second phase of building wealth,
4:05:21
power and cohesiveness without threatening the leading world power, that is the United States, occurred
4:05:27
under Deng and his successors up toQi. The third phase of building on these
4:05:33
accomplishments and moving China toward where it has set out to be on the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of
4:05:40
China in 2049, which is to be a quote unquote modern socialist country that is
4:05:46
prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and harmonious is
4:05:52
occurring underQI and his successors. Its ultimate goal is to make the Chinese
4:05:58
economy about twice the size of the US's and to have the benefits of its growth
4:06:03
broadly shared. Because China's population is about four times as large
4:06:08
as the US's, it only takes an income that is half as much per capita to have
4:06:13
twice as much in total. There is nothing that I can see that stands in the way of
4:06:18
China and the US having comparable per capita incomes over time, which would make China four times bigger.
4:06:26
Nearer-term goals and ways to achieve them were set out in the made in China 2025 plan. The made in China 2025 plan
4:06:35
is for China to be largely self-sufficient in most areas and to be world leaders in high-tech fields
4:06:42
including artificial intelligence, robotics, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and
4:06:48
aerospace. CHI's new China standards plan 2035 and the usual five-year plans.
4:06:56
In March 2021, China released their 14th 5-year plan and targets for
4:07:03
2035. Chinese leaders don't just try to implement their plans. They set out
4:07:09
clear metrics by which to judge their performance and they achieve most of their goals. I'm not saying that this
4:07:16
process is perfect because it isn't. And I'm not saying that they don't have political and other challenges that lead
4:07:21
to disagreements including some brutal fights over what should be done because they do in private. What I am saying is
4:07:30
that the Chinese have much longerterm and historically based perspectives and planning horizons which they break down
4:07:37
into shorter term plans and ways of operating and they have done an excellent job of achieving what they
4:07:43
have set out to do by following this approach. Coincidentally, my own search
4:07:48
for patterns in history and my way of dealing with tactical decisions has had a similar effect on how I see and do
4:07:55
things. For example, I now view the last 500 years as recent history. The most
4:08:01
relevant historical arcs seem about 100 plus years long. And the patterns I have
4:08:06
gleaned from this perspective help me anticipate how events are likely to transpire and how I should be positioned
4:08:13
for them over the coming weeks, months, and years. China's lessons and its ways of
4:08:21
operating. Chinese culture developed as an extension of the experiences the Chinese
4:08:28
had and the lessons they learned from them over the course of millennia. These were set out in philosophies about how
4:08:36
things work and what ways work best in dealing with those realities which made
4:08:41
clear how people should be with each other, how political decision-making should be done and how economic systems
4:08:47
should work. In the western world, the dominant philosophies are Judeo-Christian, democratic, and
4:08:53
capitalist socialist. And each individual pretty much chooses from them to come up with a mix that suits them.
4:09:01
In China, the main philosophies were Confucian, Dowist, and legalist until the early 20th century when Marxism and
4:09:09
capitalism entered the mix. Emperors typically choose their own preferences,
4:09:14
put them into practice, learn, and adapt. If the mix works, the dynasty
4:09:20
survives and prospers. In their parliament, it has the mandate of heaven. If it doesn't, it fails and is
4:09:27
replaced by another. This process has gone on from before history was recorded
4:09:33
and will go on for as long as there are people who have to decide how to do things
4:09:39
collectively. While I can't do these philosophies justice in a couple of sentences, here are my attempts.
4:09:47
Confucianism seeks to bring about harmony by ensuring that people know their roles in the hierarchy and how to
4:09:54
play them well. Starting from within the family between the husband and the wife, the father and the son, the older
4:10:00
sibling and the younger sibling, etc., and extending up to the ruler and their
4:10:05
subjects. Each person respects and obeys those above them who are benevolent and
4:10:11
at the same time impose strict standards of behavior. All people are expected to
4:10:16
be kind, honest, and fair. Confucianism values harmony, broad-based education,
4:10:23
and meritocracy. Legalism favors the rapid
4:10:28
conquest and unification of everything under heaven by an autocratic leader. It
4:10:34
argues that the world is a kill orbe killed jungle in which strict obedience to the emperor's central government is
4:10:41
required without much benevolence given in return. The western equivalent of
4:10:46
legalism is fascism. Dowoism teaches that it is of
4:10:52
paramount importance to live in harmony with the laws of nature. Dowists believe
4:10:57
that nature is composed of opposites, yin and yang, and that harmony is achieved when they are balanced
4:11:05
well. Until the early 20th century, when Marxism gained favor with Mao and his
4:11:11
successors, Confucianism and Neo Confucianism were the most influential
4:11:16
philosophies, usually with some legalism thrown in. I will briefly explain
4:11:21
Marxism when we get into the 20th century. All of these Chinese systems are
4:11:27
hierarchical and non-egalitarian. Wong Chi, the vice
4:11:32
president of China and a remarkable historian and explorer of different cultures, told me that the core
4:11:38
difference between Americans and the Chinese is that Americans hold the individual above all else, while the
4:11:45
Chinese put the family and the collective above everything. America is run from the
4:11:51
bottom up. for example, democracy and optimized for the individual. China is
4:11:57
run from the top down and optimized for the collective. The Chinese word country
4:12:02
consists of the two characters for state and family, he explained. So, Chinese
4:12:08
leaders seek to run their state the way they think parents should run their families with each person knowing their
4:12:14
place and having filial respect for those above them. As a result, the Chinese are more humble, respectful, and
4:12:21
rulesbound, while Americans are more arrogant, egalitarian, and rules averse.
4:12:28
I've observed that while the Chinese are more interested in asking questions and learning, Americans are more interested
4:12:34
in telling you what they think. As for governance structure, that
4:12:39
is who reports to whom within the hierarchy of the central government and how that extends down to interactions
4:12:46
with regional and local governments. The Chinese have evolved well-developed approaches over many dynasties and
4:12:53
thousands of years. To go into them in depth would require too great a digression.
4:12:59
Unlike other great empires that have conquered and occupied other countries, it was relatively uncommon for China to
4:13:06
occupy distant states. China is basically a giant plane surrounded by big natural borders,
4:13:13
mountains, and seas with the bulk of its population spread across the plane. Most
4:13:19
of China's world was confined within those borders and most of its wars were fought for control of it, mostly among
4:13:26
the Chinese, though sometimes between foreign invaders and the Chinese. Traditional Chinese military
4:13:33
philosophy teaches that the ideal way to win a war is not by fighting, but by
4:13:39
quietly developing one's power to the point that simply displaying it will cause an opponent to capitulate.
4:13:46
It also calls for the extensive use of psychology to influence opponents
4:13:51
behaviors. If you haven't read Sunsu's The Art of War, I suggest you do to get
4:13:56
the flavor of what I'm referring to. Still, there have been numerous violent dynastic wars inside China. The
4:14:05
few wars that were fought outside China were for the purpose of establishing China's relative power and opening
4:14:11
trade. Scholars believe that China was loathed to expand its empire because its land
4:14:17
mass was already so large and difficult to control and because they have preferred to maintain a cultural purity
4:14:24
that is best achieved through isolation. Traditionally, the Chinese have preferred to enter into relations
4:14:31
with empires outside their borders in a manner that is similar to what one might expect from the previously mentioned
4:14:38
philosophies. that is with parties knowing their places and acting accordingly. If China was more powerful,
4:14:45
which was typically the case, the less powerful states paid tribute with gifts and favors and typically received
4:14:52
guarantees of peace, recognition of their authorities, and trading opportunities in return. These
4:14:59
subordinate countries typically maintained their customs and experienced no interference in how their countries
4:15:05
were run. In his excellent book, The Chinese World Order: Traditional China's Foreign
4:15:12
Relations, the historian John Fairbank described China's relations with non-Chinese states as follows. The
4:15:20
graded and concentric hierarchy of China's foreign relations included other peoples and countries, which we may
4:15:26
group into three main zones. First, the cynic zone consisting of the most nearby
4:15:33
and culturally similar tributaries, Korea and Vietnam, parts of which had
4:15:38
anciently been ruled within the Chinese Empire and also Liuch Rayuku Islands and
4:15:44
at brief times Japan. Secondly, the inner Asian zone consisting of tributary tribes and
4:15:52
states of the nomadic or semi-nomadic peoples of inner Asia who were not only
4:15:57
ethnically and culturally non-Chinese but were also outside or on the fringes
4:16:02
of the Chinese cultural area even though sometimes pressing upon the great wall frontier.
4:16:09
Third, the outer zone consisting of the outer barbarians we generally at further
4:16:16
distance over land or sea including eventually Japan and other states of Southeast and South Asia and Europe that
4:16:23
were supposed to send tribute when trading China's monetary and economic
4:16:32
history. As for money, credit, and the economy, the history is very long and
4:16:37
complicated. That said, China has gone through the full range of money, credit, economic systems and cycles that I
4:16:44
described earlier when discussing the big cycle of money and credit. The currency the Chinese used the most was
4:16:51
metal, mostly copper coins and some silver domestically, which continued
4:16:57
long after China invented paper money in the 9th century until the introduction of the yuan in the late 19th century.
4:17:04
Silver was the main currency used internationally, though gold was also sometimes
4:17:10
used. Understanding the different systems is especially important for China as they shifted frequently between
4:17:17
them and it helped produce prosperity or ruin in different periods depending on how the system was managed.
4:17:24
China experienced several cycles of one transitioning from hard currency to
4:17:29
paperbacked by hard currency, type one to type two, then two, seeing trust in
4:17:36
the currency increase until the paper currency was circulated with no backing type two to type three. Then three,
4:17:44
having the paper currency collapse due to overprinting and loss of faith leading to the return to a hard
4:17:51
currency. Type three to type one. As I explained in chapter 3, there
4:17:57
are three basic types of monetary systems. In the first, which I call a type one monetary system, money has
4:18:04
intrinsic value because the coins are made from gold, silver, and copper. In
4:18:09
the second, which I call a type two monetary system, money is linked to assets that have intrinsic value,
4:18:16
typically in the form of paper notes that can be exchanged for gold or silver at a fixed price. In a type three or
4:18:23
fiat monetary system, money is not linked to anything objective.
4:18:29
The attached diagram transitions across different types of money in Chinese history conveys an ultraimplified
4:18:36
picture of how these currency systems rotated throughout China's history since the Tang
4:18:42
Dynasty. In fact, different parts of China had different currencies and at times used coins and ingots from other
4:18:49
countries, for example, Spanish silver dollars in the late 16th century.
4:18:54
Still, the diagram is broadly indicative and meant to show that China had the same range of monetary systems as the
4:19:01
rest of the world, and they worked in essentially the same ways, most importantly, with cycles in which hard
4:19:07
money was abandoned due to debt problems leading to inflation, hyperinflation, and finally a return to hard
4:19:15
money. At the start of the Tang Dynasty, money primarily consisted of copper
4:19:20
coins, that is hard currency. But as is classic, the supply of hard currency
4:19:26
proved to be constraining. China was growing quickly and the supply of copper wasn't keeping up to provide enough
4:19:32
money. Additionally, each copper coin was of low value and so to trade
4:19:37
merchants had to physically carry perhaps hundreds of thousands of copper coins, which was
4:19:43
impractical. These pressures led to the invention of the earliest forms of non-h hard money-like instruments. Flying cash
4:19:52
started out as essentially drafts from a bank like checks, but merchants would circulate them like money. Eventually,
4:19:59
the Tang government started to supervise their issuance and use. These promisory
4:20:05
notes were similar to what today would be called a bill of exchange. Earlier promisory notes were denominated in
4:20:12
variable units, but eventually governmentissued notes were in fixed denominations.
4:20:17
The government office issued these notes known as Xiaozi and Wheezi in exchange
4:20:23
for cash coins. That said, day-to-day monetary transactions continued to be mainly in
4:20:30
copper coinage. True paper money that is designed to be in widespread use as
4:20:36
legal tender came a bit later in Chinese history. In the early 1100s during the
4:20:42
Song Dynasty, the government took over the money-making industry and created the first commoditybacked paper money.
4:20:50
The paper money soon was accepted and what it was backed by took on a subordinate
4:20:55
importance. Thus began an early version of a fiat monetary system. However,
4:21:01
similar to bonds, the paper money had a maturity date after which it was retired.
4:21:07
The Song Dynasty not only invented fiat money, they also were the first to overprint and devalue paper money. By
4:21:15
the mid 1100s, the financial demands on the Song Treasury were extremely high
4:21:20
due to foreign wars and domestic revolts. As is quite typical of the declines of empires, rather than
4:21:27
increasing taxes or cutting spending, which they didn't want to do because it would have increased discontent, they
4:21:34
printed fiat currency to fund their deficits. Initially, the monetization of
4:21:40
deficits was manageable. The first fiat currency known as notes was issued in
4:21:45
modest quantities starting in 1160 and traded at near face value for more than 30 years. But the Song government soon
4:21:54
printed more freely, more than tripling the amount of whisy in circulation. As internal and external
4:22:01
conflicts continued to strain the imperial treasury, the money supply nearly tripled again between 1209 and
4:22:09
1231. As a result, the market value of that paper money measured in speci coins
4:22:15
fell by over 90% between 1195 and the 1230s.
4:22:21
The same patterns repeated several more times. The Yuan dynasty feeling
4:22:26
constrained by metal currency created a new paper currency which Marco Polo marveled at but then overprinted it
4:22:34
causing the currency to eventually collapse. The early Ming dynasty also
4:22:40
feeling constrained by metal currency created paper money to provide funds to establish a new state but then
4:22:46
overprinted it eventually causing the currency to collapse. These are fascinating stories I won't delve into
4:22:55
now. Following the failure of fiat money at the start of the Ming dynasty, China
4:23:00
gave up experimentation with paper currencies until the 20th century. Instead, from the mid-14th century to
4:23:07
around 1933, China had different types of metal coins, primarily silver. The intrinsic
4:23:14
value of that silver constituted the significant majority of their value, though there was some premium placed on
4:23:21
the coins themselves. For a major portion of that time, largely up until
4:23:26
1933, China didn't mint, and the coins came first from Spain, then Mexico, then
4:23:32
North America. In 1933, the Chinese chose to create their own national
4:23:38
coinage, which began to circulate. Two years later, the Chinese government decided to replace the yuan with the
4:23:45
Fabi, which means legal tender, in order to move from a currency they couldn't print to one they could. The Fabi in
4:23:53
turn experienced increasingly rampant hyperinflation due to overprinting by the Republic of China government in
4:24:00
World War II and the final phases of the Chinese civil war that followed.
4:24:05
Following the foundation of the People's Republic of China, PRC, the Renmanb was
4:24:10
introduced and remains in use to this day. As for China's broader economy, it
4:24:17
went from being primarily agricultural and feudal through a variety of manufacturing incarnations such as the
4:24:24
Bronze Age and the Iron Age, and developed various approaches to trading with foreigners, most importantly
4:24:30
through the Silk Road. This gave rise to a rich merchant class producing cycles
4:24:36
in which big wealth gaps developed followed by uprisings in which their wealth was seized. Since China has
4:24:43
always been an intelligent and industrious society, numerous technological inventions moved its
4:24:49
economy forward. Private entrepreneurial businesses also arose at different times in China's
4:24:56
history, producing cycles in which wealth disparities grew until governments expropriated and
4:25:02
redistributed wealth in countless ways. China experienced debt cycles like those
4:25:07
described in chapter 3 as well, which took place for the same reasons. There
4:25:12
were stable periods within these big debt cycles when debt growth wasn't excessive, bubble periods when it was
4:25:20
crisis periods when there wasn't enough money to service debt, and inflationary and sometimes hyperinflationary periods
4:25:27
when money was printed to alleviate the debt crisis. It's interesting to note that
4:25:33
while the most powerful empires had global reserve currencies, this has not been true for China's most powerful
4:25:40
dynasties. That is because in the years prior to
4:25:46
frequent oceanic travel, there was no such thing as a global reserve currency. Trade was limited and generally
4:25:53
conducted in precious metals. And throughout its history, China never became such an extensive empire that is
4:25:59
a world power that a large portion of the world wanted to transact with and hold its promisory notes as storeholds
4:26:07
of wealth. China never established a financial center rivaling those in Europe and it
4:26:13
was much less commercial. While China was ahead in financial market development in the Song Dynasty,
4:26:19
establishing the first stock companies and using paper currency, by the 1600s,
4:26:25
financial capital market developments in China were far behind those in Europe.
4:26:31
Culturally being commercial was not held in high regard by China's leaders. So
4:26:36
there was less development of the commercial legal system and the financial markets. Because of that
4:26:42
lesser commercial development and its more isolationist policies, China generally fell behind Europe in terms of
4:26:49
innovation which we will discuss later. Further, China's support for
4:26:54
private commerce and financial markets was inconsistent. stronger in the Song and Tang periods and then more hostile
4:27:02
in the Ming andQing when global trade empires were first being established. As a result, the social and
4:27:09
legal structures were less conducive to capital accumulation investment. For
4:27:14
example, corporate law was much less developed than in Europe and Chinese businesses tended to be familyowned.
4:27:22
Also, the state overall was less willing and able to invest in strategic industries or push innovation. Confucian
4:27:30
ideology probably played a role in this as merchants, business people were of lower status compared to scholars, a
4:27:37
viewpoint that strengthened as more conservative strains of Confucianism gained sway in the Ming andQing
4:27:44
dynasties. Debt grew dramatically during the civil
4:27:49
unrest and wars of the 1920s and30s which led to the classic cycle in which
4:27:55
promises to deliver money far exceed capacities to do so. This caused
4:28:01
widespread defaults which classically led to the abandonment of the metal standard and the outlawing of metal
4:28:07
coins and private ownership of silver. As previously explained, currencies are
4:28:13
used for one domestic transactions which the government has a monopoly in
4:28:19
controlling and hence can be carried out with fiat or even flimflam currencies
4:28:25
and two international transactions in which the currencies must be of real
4:28:30
value or they won't be accepted. The test of the real value of a currency is
4:28:35
whether it is actively used and traded at the same exchange rate internationally as domestically. When
4:28:42
there are capital controls that prevent the free exchange of a domestic currency internationally, that currency is more
4:28:48
susceptible to being devalued. By definition, reserve currencies have no
4:28:54
such controls. So as a principle, when you see capital controls being put on a
4:28:59
currency, especially when there is a big domestic debt problem, run from that
4:29:06
currency. China had two currencies in the 1930s, a fiat paper one for domestic
4:29:12
transactions and a gold one for international payments. The Fiat Paper
4:29:17
One was printed abundantly and frequently devalued. After the turbulence of World War II and the
4:29:23
Chinese Civil War, in December 1948, the first Renmanb was issued as a fiat
4:29:29
currency and it was kept in limited supply to end the hyperinflation. In 1955, a second
4:29:36
issuance of Renmanb was made and in 1962, a third. From 1955 to 1971, the
4:29:44
exchange rate was fixed at 2.46 to the US dollar. Then there was another round
4:29:50
of high inflation in the 1970s and 80s, which was caused by the global devaluation of money against gold in
4:29:58
1971, global inflationary pressures, China phasing out its price controls,
4:30:04
easy credit, and a lack of spending controls among state-owned enterprises.
4:30:09
In 2005, the peg to the dollar was ended. The next PDF chart shows Chinese
4:30:17
inflation rates going back to 1750, including the periods of
4:30:22
hyperinflation. The era of relatively stable inflation early on was largely the result of China using metals,
4:30:29
silver, and copper as money, which were valued by weight. When theQing dynasty broke down,
4:30:36
provinces declared independence and issued their own silver and copper coins which were also valued by their weights.
4:30:44
This is why there were not exceptionally high levels of inflation even during this terrible
4:30:50
period. The following PDF charts show the value of Chinese currency in dollar
4:30:55
and gold terms since 1920 plus the inflation and growth rates over that
4:31:00
period. As you can see, there were two major periods of devaluation. The first
4:31:07
when the new exchange rate was set up in 1948 and between 1980 and the 1990s when
4:31:13
there was a series of devaluations aimed to support exporters and manage current
4:31:18
account deficits which caused very high inflation. The devaluations in 1985 and86 and
4:31:26
1993 came after a period of opening up trade and an expansion in special
4:31:31
economic zones. These openings created immense demand for foreign currency and
4:31:37
imports to build production capacity. But it would still be a couple more years before those zones yielded much
4:31:44
higher exports. That mismatch contributed to China's growing current account
4:31:50
deficit. As shown, growth was relatively fast and erratic until around 1978, then
4:31:57
fast and much less erratic until the recent brief plunge due to the CO 19
4:32:03
pandemic. While most Chinese have a strong desire to save and an appropriate
4:32:09
sense of risk that innately drives them to store their wealth and safe liquid assets, for example, cash deposits and
4:32:16
tangible assets, for example, real estate and some gold. Some investors have limited experiences with riskier
4:32:23
assets such as equities and risky debt and so can be naive though they are
4:32:29
learning very fast. But when it comes to Chinese policymakers understanding of
4:32:34
money, credit, monetary policy, fiscal policy and how to restructure bad debts,
4:32:41
I have found them to have the same kinds of deep and timeless perspectives that they have for the rest of their
4:32:48
history. from 1800 until now. I'll begin with a brief overview of
4:32:55
the period between 1800 and the foundation of the People's Republic of China in
4:33:00
1949. Examine the Mao period a bit more closely. Then take a deeper look at the
4:33:06
period spanning the rise of Deng Xiaoping from 1978 to 1997 and the
4:33:12
advent of Xihinping in 2012 until now. Then in the next chapter we will look at
4:33:18
US China relations. The decline from 1800 until
4:33:26
1949. China's post 1800 decline began when A the last Chinese royal dynasty
4:33:33
theqing dynasty became decadent and weak at the same time that B. The British and
4:33:38
some other western countries became strong, which led British and other capitalist colonialists to increasingly
4:33:45
take control of China economically. Meanwhile, C, China's
4:33:50
financial and monetary system broke down under the burden of debts that couldn't be paid and the printing of money that
4:33:57
caused a collapse in its value. While D, there were massive domestic rebellions
4:34:02
and civil wars. The massive Taiping Rebellion, one of the bloodiest wars in human history,
4:34:09
which led to an estimated 20 to 30 million killed, caused a giant fiscal crisis that led to an issuance of debt
4:34:16
that got monetized and led to high inflation. That severe big cycle decline
4:34:23
in which all the major strengths were in mutually reinforcing freef falls continued from around 1840 until 1949.
4:34:32
The end of World War II in 1945 led to the repatriation of most foreigners in
4:34:38
China except for Hong Kong and Taiwan and a civil war to determine how the
4:34:43
wealth and power would be divided. That is a war between the communists and the capitalists on the Chinese mainland.
4:34:51
This long period of decline was a classic case of the archetypical big cycle and it was followed by an equally
4:34:57
classic case of a big cycle upswing in which a new leader wins control, consolidates power and begins building
4:35:05
the basic structures that are passed on to succeeding generations who build on each other's accomplishments.
4:35:12
As discussed in previous chapters, the early 1800s was the time of Britain's
4:35:17
rise and expansion across the globe, which brought the rising British Empire into greater contact with China. The
4:35:25
British East India Company wanted tea, silk, and porcelain from China because it was extremely lucrative to sell back
4:35:32
home. However, the British didn't have anything that the Chinese wanted to trade for. So they had to pay for these
4:35:38
goods and silver which was a global money at the time. When the British
4:35:43
began to run out of silver, they smuggled opium into China from India which they sold for silver which they
4:35:49
then used to pay for Chinese goods. The Chinese fought to stop those sales which
4:35:55
led to the first opium war in which the technologically superior British Navy
4:36:00
defeated the Chinese in 1839 to42 leading Britain to impose a treaty that
4:36:06
gave the British Hong Kong and opened up a number of Chinese ports most notably
4:36:11
Shanghai to traders from Britain as well as other powers in subsequent treaties
4:36:17
which eventually led to the loss of large parts of northern China to Russia and Japan. Japan and the loss of what we
4:36:23
now call Taiwan to Japan. TheQing government borrowed
4:36:29
heavily from foreigners to fight internal rebellions. Reparations, especially after the Boxer Rebellion, a
4:36:36
Chinese rebellion against foreigners in 1901, also created huge
4:36:41
liabilities. When the rebellion failed, the victorious foreign powers demanded the equivalent of about 18,000 tons of
4:36:49
silver, which was structured around a 40-year debt that was guaranteed by the tariff income on the ports they
4:36:56
controlled. TheQing government starved of financial resources, faced many
4:37:01
uprisings over the couple decades following the opium wars, and spent down their savings to finance fighting them.
4:37:09
The combination of one not having strong leadership, two not having sound
4:37:14
finances, three having internal rebellions that undermined productivity and were costly in money and lives.
4:37:22
Four, fighting foreigners which was costly financially and in lives. And
4:37:27
five, experiencing some big disruptive acts of nature produced the mutually and
4:37:33
self-reinforcing decline known as the century of humiliation.
4:37:38
It is easy to see the important role that period has played in shaping Chinese leaders perspectives. For
4:37:45
example, why Mao saw capitalism as a system in which companies pursued profits through imperialism, that is
4:37:52
through the control and exploitation of countries just as the British and other capitalist powers did to China,
4:37:59
enriching the greedy elites while exploiting workers. Mao's view of capitalism differs from my
4:38:06
own because his experience with it was so different. Though both of our views of it are true. Capitalism has provided
4:38:14
me and most others I know including immigrants from all over the world with enormous opportunities. The America I
4:38:22
came of age in was the land of opportunity in which one could learn, contribute, and be rewarded fairly and
4:38:29
without boundaries. This experience of seeing through another's eyes was another reminder for
4:38:35
me of how important radical open-mindedness and thoughtful disagreement are to finding out what is
4:38:41
true. It led me to study Marxism a bit so I could understand why it made sense
4:38:47
to Mao and others as a philosophy. My inclination up until then was to think of it as at best
4:38:54
impractical and at worst a potentially evil threat. Yet I was ignorant about
4:38:59
what Marx had actually said. Enter Marxism
4:39:06
Leninism. Before I examined it for myself, I'd assumed that Marxism
4:39:12
Leninism was a dysfunctional system in which resources were theoretically distributed from each according to his
4:39:19
abilities to each according his needs that failed to produce much because of
4:39:24
its lack of incentives to be inventive and efficient. I didn't appreciate that
4:39:30
Markx was a brilliant man who came up with some good theories and some seemingly bad ones that he would
4:39:36
probably agree were not adequately tested and refined by the evolutionary system he espoused.
4:39:42
Now I wonder how Marx, a very practical man who believed that philosophies should only be judged by the successes
4:39:49
and failures they produce, would have diagnosed communism's near total and universal failure and changed his
4:39:57
thinking as a result. Marx's most important theory system is called dialectical
4:40:04
materialism. Dialectical refers to how opposites interact to produce change and
4:40:11
materialism means that everything has a material that is physical existence that
4:40:16
interacts with other things in a mechanical way. In a nutshell, dialectical materialism is a system for
4:40:23
producing change by observing and influencing the contradictions of opposites that produce struggles that
4:40:30
when resolved produce progress. Markx meant it to apply to everything.
4:40:36
The conflict and struggle between the classes that is manifest in the conflict between capitalism and communism is just
4:40:43
one of many such examples. Much of that sounds right to me.
4:40:49
Though I'm no expert on Marxism, the process of dialectical materialism is similar to the process that I discovered
4:40:56
for myself and explained in my book principles life and work in which I
4:41:01
struggle with conflicts, reflect on them, write down the principles I derive from them and then improve them and do
4:41:08
that over and over again in a neverending evolutionary way that I describe as looping. In other words, I
4:41:16
believe and it sounds like Markx believed that learning and evolving from conflicts and mistakes is the best
4:41:22
approach. It is also my opinion that capitalism, an incentive system that rewards the
4:41:29
people who are most inventive and productive and that has capital markets that reward good capital allocation
4:41:35
decisions and penalizes bad ones will lead to a more productivity over the
4:41:41
long run and hence a bigger total pie, b wealth differences and c capital markets
4:41:49
especially debt markets that become overextended and then break down. When
4:41:54
there is a capital market economic breakdown at the same time that there are big wealth and values disparities,
4:42:01
that is likely to lead to some form of revolution. Such revolutions can end
4:42:06
harmoniously and productively, but most are preceded by great conflict and
4:42:11
destruction. So thus far, the way Markx appeared to see things and the way I see
4:42:17
things aren't radically different, though what we would choose and what we would think should be done are probably
4:42:24
radically different. If you ask me a whether I'd rather have what capitalism
4:42:30
has delivered or what communism delivered and b if I think the capitalist path we have now is more
4:42:36
logical than the communist path we have seen, I'd choose capitalism as my answer
4:42:42
to both. On the other hand, if you asked me A, if both the capitalist and the
4:42:47
communist systems need to be reformed to make the pie grow more effectively and to be distributed more fairly, and B, if
4:42:55
Marx's dialectical materialism approach to evolving and my five-step process to
4:43:00
evolving are broadly similar and the best ways of evolving. Well, I would say
4:43:06
yes to both questions without getting hung up on how exactly our two approaches are different.
4:43:13
Also, as far as the wealth gap goes, I share the view that it has been a big
4:43:18
issue throughout history that can threaten all systems. I too believe that conflicts produce struggle and that
4:43:25
working through struggle produces progress. I consider the conflicts between the
4:43:30
classes that is the halves and the have nots to be among the main drivers of the
4:43:35
rise and decline of empires and hence the progress of history with those drivers being the three big cycles money
4:43:42
and credit internal order disorder and external order disorder discussed
4:43:48
earlier in this book. All of those cycles across the leading countries were in their decline conflict
4:43:55
phases between 1930 and 1945 which led to revolutions and wars
4:44:00
in China and all over the world. But as always happens, the forces of decline
4:44:06
ran their course and new domestic and world orders began. More specifically, the external
4:44:13
war ended in 1945 and foreign forces left most of mainland China. China's
4:44:19
communists and capitalists then fought an internal war that ended in 1949 which
4:44:24
led to a new domestic order which was communism under Mao. Put yourself in Mao's position
4:44:31
during the 1900 to 1949 period. Imagine him reading what Marx wrote and think
4:44:38
about his actions during that period and in the post 1949 period. It makes sense
4:44:43
that Mao was a Marxist and held the established Confucian approach to harmony and disdain. Democracy as we
4:44:51
know it doesn't have any roots in China. Legalism with its autocratic approach
4:44:57
does. Capitalism on the other hand is growing and becoming much more deeply rooted today.
4:45:04
Lenin built on what Markx said to create a two-step process for building the state in which there is at first a
4:45:11
vanguard of workers through democratic centralism in which only members of the party vote which eventually leads to a
4:45:18
higher communist state in which there is common ownership of the means of production social and economic equality
4:45:25
and general prosperity. Mao liked the Marxist Leninist approach
4:45:30
in which the achievement of the communist ideal came at the end of a very long evolutionary
4:45:36
process. Deng Xiaoing reiterated this view in an interview with 60 Minutes in
4:45:42
1986 in which he said that the capitalism he was adopting and communism
4:45:47
were not incompatible. According to Marxism, he said communist society is based on
4:45:53
material abundance. Only when there is material abundance can the principle of a communist society from each according
4:46:00
to his ability to each according to his needs be applied. Socialism is the first
4:46:07
stage of communism. Maybe that's true and maybe it's not. Time will tell to
4:46:14
me. Thus far, capitalism in China or anywhere else is winning the competition.
4:46:20
However, there can be no question that the Chinese mix of communism and capitalism has produced remarkable
4:46:27
economic results over the last 40 years. In the next section, I will very
4:46:33
briefly summarize what happened between 1949 and now. Then I will delve into
4:46:38
each of its phases in greater detail.
4:46:44
The rise from 1949 until now. Though it's a bit of an
4:46:50
oversimplification, we can think of China's evolution from 1949 until now as
4:46:55
occurring in three phases. One, the Mao phase from 1949 to
4:47:03
1976. Two, the Deng and Dengs successors phase from 1978 to 2012 when Xi Jinping
4:47:11
came to power. Three, the Chiinping phase from 2012
4:47:16
until now. Each phase moved China along the arc of its long-term development,
4:47:23
building on its earlier accomplishments. In brief, events transpired as follows.
4:47:30
From 1949 until he died in 1976, Mao with his various ministers,
4:47:36
most importantly Zhao and Li consolidated power, built China's
4:47:41
foundation of institutions, governance and infrastructure, and ruled China as a
4:47:46
communist emperor. Isolated from the rest of the world, China followed a strict communist system in which the
4:47:53
government owned everything and maintained tight bureaucratic controls. Immediately following the deaths of Mao
4:48:00
and Xiaoen Lie, there was a power struggle in 1976 to78 between the gang
4:48:06
of four hardliners and the reformists. Deng Xiaoing and the reformists emerged victorious in 1978
4:48:15
leading to the second phase. Deng and his ministers ran China
4:48:20
directly or indirectly until his death in 1997. During this phase, China moved to a more
4:48:27
collective leadership model, opened up to the outside world, introduced and developed market capitalist practices,
4:48:34
and became much stronger financially and more powerful in other ways that didn't appear threatening to the United States
4:48:41
or to other countries. To finance what was then viewed as a symbiotic relationship in which the US
4:48:48
bought items that were attractively priced from China, China lent Americans
4:48:53
money. As a result, the US acquired US dollar denominated debt liabilities and
4:48:59
the Chinese acquired dollar denominated assets. After Deng's death, his
4:49:04
successors Jang Zamin and Huin Tao and those who led China with them continued
4:49:10
in the same direction. So, China's wealth and power grew in fundamentally sound ways that did not appear
4:49:17
threatening to the US. In 2008, the global financial crisis came along,
4:49:23
which led to greater tensions over wealth in the United States and other developed countries, increased
4:49:29
resentment at the flight of manufacturing jobs to China, and increased debt financed growth in all
4:49:35
countries including China. Chi Jinping came to power in 2012,
4:49:41
presiding over a richer, more powerful China that was becoming overly indebted, too corrupt, and increasingly at odds
4:49:48
with the United States. He accelerated economic reforms, took on the challenge
4:49:54
of trying to contain debt growth while aggressively reforming the economy, supported the building of leading
4:50:00
technologies, and took an increasingly global stance. He also became more
4:50:05
proactive in reducing China's gaps in education and its income inequality, in
4:50:10
protecting the environment, and in consolidating political control. As China's powers grew and Chi's bold
4:50:17
objectives, for example, the Belt and Road Initiative and the Made in China 2025 plan became more apparent, tensions
4:50:26
with the US rose, especially after Donald Trump was elected president, a populist nationalist who campaigned on
4:50:34
stanching the US's loss of manufacturing jobs to China. China's position visav
4:50:40
the United States became one of a rapidly strengthening power challenging the dominant
4:50:46
one. Now let's take a closer look. Phase 1, building the foundation
4:50:54
1949 to 1976. Mao and the communists won the
4:51:00
civil war and started the People's Republic of China in 1949 and quickly
4:51:05
consolidated power. Mao became the de facto emperor titled chairman of the
4:51:10
people's republic of China and Zhao Enli his prime minister titled
4:51:16
premier. Domestically the new government quickly repaired transportation and communications infrastructure and
4:51:22
nationalized the banking system under the eegis of the new central bank the people's bank of China. To bring down
4:51:30
inflation it tightened credit and stabilized the value of the currency. The government also nationalized most
4:51:37
businesses and redistributed agricultural land from large land owners to the peasants who farmed the land.
4:51:45
Whether one worked or not, one received basic pay. There was no merit-based pay.
4:51:51
The protections that these guaranteed basic incomes and benefits provided everyone were collectively called the
4:51:58
iron rice bowl. These changes created a stable economy but little motivation.
4:52:05
Internationally, China was isolationist, though it wasn't long before the new government found itself in a war. As
4:52:12
explained in the last chapter, in 1945, the new world order divided the world
4:52:18
into two main ideological camps. The democratic capitalists led by the United
4:52:23
States and the autocratic communists led by the Soviet Union with a third group of countries that were not committed to
4:52:30
either side. Many of these non-aligned countries had until recently been
4:52:35
colonies, most notably under the declining British Empire. China was clearly in the Sovietled camp. On
4:52:43
February 14th, 1950, Mao and Stalin signed the Treaty of Friendship,
4:52:48
alliance, and mutual assistance to cooperate and come to each other's aid militarily.
4:52:55
At the end of World War II, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel with the Russians controlling the North and the
4:53:02
Americans the South. In June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea. The Chinese
4:53:09
stayed out of the fighting initially as they were preoccupied with their own challenges and didn't want to be drawn
4:53:14
into a war. In conjunction with the United Nations, the United States responded by bringing
4:53:20
its forces into the fighting, taking the war into North Korea, which borders
4:53:25
China. The Chinese viewed this as a threat, especially since US General Douglas MacArthur made it clear that he
4:53:32
would attack China. Though the Soviets and the Chinese had a pack to support each other, Stalin didn't want to go to
4:53:39
war with the United States. So, he didn't provide China with the military support it expected. Though the Chinese
4:53:46
were illprepared for war against the much greater and nuclear armed American power, the Chinese entered the war,
4:53:54
pushing the American and UN troops back to the previously established border. This was Mao's first great
4:54:01
challenge, and it is considered a great victory by the Chinese. Between the PRC's founding in
4:54:08
1949 and Mao's death in 1976, the Chinese economy grew rather quickly at
4:54:14
an average annual rate of about 6% with an average annual inflation rate of around 1 to2% accumulating around $4
4:54:22
billion in foreign exchange reserves. This represented a modest improvement,
4:54:28
but China remained poor and there was a lot of volatility along the way.
4:54:34
Specifically, between 1952 and 1957, with the help of the Soviets, industrial
4:54:40
production grew at 19% a year. National income grew at 9% a year, and
4:54:46
agricultural production grew by 4% a year. The Chinese government built
4:54:51
industrial facilities and imported lots of equipment from the Soviets. It also reformed its agricultural practices and
4:54:59
methods by creating cooperatives to achieve economies of scale by having farmers work
4:55:05
together. These were highly productive years. However, after Stalin's death in
4:55:11
1953, Nikita Cruchef came to power, criticized Stalin and his policies, and
4:55:16
alienated Mao, which led to these Chinese and Soviet leaders openly criticizing each other, which began a
4:55:23
period of reduced Soviet support. Around 1960, the Soviet Union
4:55:29
shifted from being an ally to being an enemy and withdrew economic
4:55:35
support. From 1958 through 1962, due to a drought, economic mismanagement from
4:55:42
the top-down mandated attempt to become an industrial power called the Great Leap Forward and reduced Soviet economic
4:55:49
support, the economy contracted by 25% and an estimated 16 to 40 million people
4:55:56
died of famine. Estimates suggest that over that period industrial output fell
4:56:01
by 19% in aggregate with a fall of around 36% from the 1959 peak.
4:56:09
Historians agree that it was a terrible period though there is some disagreement about how much it was terrible because
4:56:15
of terrible management by Mao versus other causes. Between 1963 and 1966, the
4:56:23
economy recovered and went to new highs. But then came the cultural
4:56:28
revolution. As is classic in all cycles, challenges to Mao's leadership and
4:56:34
ideology arose. Since most Chinese emperors were taken down by insiders,
4:56:40
this risk had to be on Mao's mind and everyone else's. So from 1966 until 1976
4:56:48
he fostered a political revolution called the cultural revolution to purify class ranks and reinforce Mao Za Dong
4:56:56
thought. Mao won the political ideological battle purging his rival Lin
4:57:02
Bao who died in a plane crash during a botched coup he was accused of organizing and Mao Dong thought was
4:57:09
written into the constitution. The cost of Mao's triumph was appalling. The cultural revolution
4:57:16
curtailed education and damaged or cost countless lives. Estimates range from
4:57:22
hundreds of thousands to as many as 20 million dead and dealt a huge blow to
4:57:27
the Chinese economy. By the early 1970s, the situation had begun to stabilize under
4:57:33
the operational leadership of Premier Zhao Li. In 1969, there were clashes
4:57:40
between Chinese and Russian troops along the border. 1971 was a year of great change
4:57:47
in China. The cultural revolution was producing turmoil and Mao's health was
4:57:52
declining. That contributed to Zhao Li playing an increasing leadership role
4:57:57
from the background which led him being elected vicechairman of the Communist Party in
4:58:03
1973 putting him in the position of appearing to be Mao's successor. Also in 1971, China was
4:58:10
threatened by the Soviet Union which was militarily much more powerful and shared a 2500m border with China leading to
4:58:18
increasing border threats. In 1975, after the US withdrew from Vietnam,
4:58:25
which shares a 900-mile border with southern China, Russia built an alliance
4:58:30
with Vietnam and moved in troops and arms. Mao had a geopolitical principle
4:58:35
to identify the main enemy, neutralize the enemy's allies, and draw them away
4:58:40
from the enemy. Mao identified the Soviet Union as China's main enemy and recognized that
4:58:47
the Soviets were in a war with the United States that hadn't yet turned hot but could. That led him to make the
4:58:55
strategic move of approaching the US. Henry Kissinger quoted Chinese officials
4:59:01
as saying, "The last thing the US imperialists are willing to see is a
4:59:06
victory by Soviet revisionists in a Sino Soviet war, as this would allow the
4:59:11
Soviets to build up a big empire more powerful than the American Empire in
4:59:16
resources and manpower. I also know that Zhao Enli, a reformist,
4:59:23
had wanted to build a strategic relationship with the United States for decades because a close Chinese friend
4:59:29
of mine, Gi Chowzu, who was Zhao and Li's interpreter for 17 years and
4:59:34
interpreted in the first Kissinger Zhao Li talks told me that that was the
4:59:40
case. Gi Chowzu was raised in the United States until he was a junior at Harvard.
4:59:46
His brother was close to Zhao and Li who sent the brother and Ji X Chaos Xu to the United States to try to build good
4:59:52
relations with Americans. When the Korean War broke out, he returned to China, became Zhao's interpreter, and
4:59:59
later served in the first Chinese delegation to the UN and as China's ambassador to England. While he told me
5:00:06
a lot that I won't discuss to respect his privacy, I don't believe that this is sensitive information.
5:00:13
China wanted to open a relationship with the United States to neutralize the Russian threat and to enhance its
5:00:20
geopolitical and economic position because in 1971 it was especially clear
5:00:26
that it was in the interests of China and the United States to build a relationship. They both made overtures
5:00:32
to establish relations. In July 1971, Kissinger and then in February 1972,
5:00:39
President Richard Nixon went to China. And in October 1971, the United Nations
5:00:45
recognized the Mauled Communist Chinese government and gave China a seat on the
5:00:50
Security Council. During Nixon's visit, Nixon and Zhao and Li signed an agreement, the Shanghai
5:00:57
communique, in which the US stated that it acknowledges that all Chinese on
5:01:03
either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain that there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China. The United
5:01:10
States government does not challenge that position. It reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan
5:01:17
question by the Chinese themselves. Despite those assurances, reunification with Taiwan still remains
5:01:24
the most consistently contentious issue between China and the US. Following those moves of
5:01:31
Rapro, US relations with China and trade and other exchanges
5:01:37
began. Then in January and September 1976, first Zhao and Li and then Mao
5:01:43
died and communist China faced its first succession crisis. From 1976 to 1978,
5:01:51
there was a fight for power between the gang of four hardline conservatives who fostered the cultural revolution and the
5:01:58
reformists who wanted economic modernization and an opening up to the outside world. The reformists won and
5:02:06
Deng Xiaoping became the paramount leader in 1978.
5:02:13
Phase two, Deng and his successors gain strengths through economic reforms and
5:02:18
opening up without creating threats to other countries. 1978 to
5:02:25
2012. Deng Xiaoping was 74 with a wealth of experience under his belt. From 1978
5:02:33
until he died in 1997, his most important policies were conveyed in a
5:02:38
single phrase, reform and opening up. Reform meant market reforms, using
5:02:44
markets to help allocate resources and incentivize people. And opening up meant
5:02:50
interacting with the outside world to learn, improve, and trade. Capitalism
5:02:56
became a part of the communist mix. China was still extremely poor. Its per
5:03:01
capita income was less than $200 a year. Deng knew these moves would make China
5:03:07
financially stronger if they were not disrupted by the far stronger foreign powers who wanted China to remain weak.
5:03:14
The key was to pursue them in ways that benefited and didn't threaten them. In
5:03:20
1979, he established full diplomatic relations with the US. Early on, Deng set out a 70-year
5:03:28
plan to A double incomes and ensure that the population would have enough food
5:03:33
and clothing by the end of the 1980s, b quadruple GDP per capita by the
5:03:39
end of the 20th century, which was achieved in 1995, 5 years ahead of
5:03:44
schedule, and C increase per capita GDP to the levels of medium-level developed
5:03:50
countries by 2050 on the 100th anniversary of the PRC.
5:03:56
He made it clear that China would achieve those goals by having a socialist market economy which he also
5:04:02
referred to as socialism with Chinese characteristics. He made that radical
5:04:08
shift without criticizing Marxism Leninism. Indeed, as noted earlier, he
5:04:13
did not see the two systems as fundamentally at odds, but rather viewed them through the lens of dialectical
5:04:19
materialism, as opposites that could be resolved, leading to progress along the long arc toward communism's ideal
5:04:27
state. During his term, Deng also reformed the decision-making structure of government. More specifically, he
5:04:35
moved its decision-making process from one that was dominated by a single leader, previously Mao, to one in which
5:04:42
the pullet bureau standing committee took votes when a consensus couldn't be reached. He also changed the system of
5:04:50
choosing the standing members of the Pullet Bureau from one in which the Supreme Leader personally selected them
5:04:56
to one in which candidates, generally qualified government officials, were chosen via consultation and negotiation
5:05:03
with experienced party elders. To institutionalize his governing philosophy, Deng shaped the
5:05:10
new Chinese Constitution, which was adopted in 1982. This new constitution also made a number
5:05:17
of changes to facilitate the economic reforms and open door policies that Deng
5:05:22
wanted. It established term limits for leaders, two 5-year terms, and
5:05:28
discouraged autocratic decision-making by formalizing his collective leadership democratic centralist policies.
5:05:36
The new constitution also provided for greater freedom of religion, opinion,
5:05:41
speech, and the press to encourage the Chinese to seek truth from facts. These reforms enabled the first
5:05:49
orderly transition of power to the next generation Polit bureau standing committee led by Jang Zamin and then on
5:05:57
to Huan Tao. With their transitions following the prescribed two five-year
5:06:02
terms, each successive leadership team kept toss basic path of making China
5:06:08
richer and more powerful by making its economy more marketdriven capitalist and
5:06:13
by increasing China's trade with and learning from other countries with those in other countries feeling more excited
5:06:20
than threatened by their interactions and trade with China. Regaining territories it lost during its
5:06:27
century of humiliation was also a very important long-term goal. In 1984, after
5:06:33
a lot of haggling with the UK, it was agreed that Hong Kong would return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 with a one
5:06:41
country, two systems approach. Then in 1986, China reached an agreement with
5:06:47
Portugal to obtain Macau's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1999.
5:06:53
In 1984, I had my first direct contact with China. I visited China at the
5:07:00
invitation of the China International Trust Investment Corporation, SITIC,
5:07:05
China's only window company, which meant that it was allowed to deal freely with the outside world, whose leaders had
5:07:12
asked me to help them understand how world financial markets work. The company had been set up as an
5:07:19
extension of Dengs reform and opening up policies and was run by Rang Yen, an old
5:07:25
Chinese capitalist who had chosen to stay in China even after his family's business was
5:07:31
nationalized. China was very poor and backward then. However, it was immediately clear to me that its people
5:07:38
were smart and civilized and its poverty was widely shared. In this regard, it
5:07:44
wasn't like most other undeveloped countries I'd been to, where the poor seemed to live in a different
5:07:50
century. China's backwardness stemmed from a general lack of access to what was available in the outside world and
5:07:57
from its demotivating system. For example, I gave out $10 calculators as
5:08:03
gifts, and even the highest ranking people thought they were miraculous devices.
5:08:08
At the time, all businesses, including small restaurants, were governmentowned and bureaucratic. The Chinese couldn't
5:08:16
choose their jobs, never mind their careers, and received no financial incentives for working well. There was
5:08:22
no private ownership of property such as one's home. And there was no contact with what the world had to offer in
5:08:29
terms of best practices and products. Because it was clear to me that the
5:08:34
closed door was the reason for China's poverty, I believed that its removal would naturally equalize its standards
5:08:41
of living with the developed world, just as unconstrained water naturally seeks
5:08:46
the same level. It was easy to visualize that happening. I remember being on the
5:08:51
10th floor of Sidic's chocolate building to give a lecture. I pointed out the
5:08:56
window at the two-story hutong, poor neighborhoods below us, and told my audience that it would not be long
5:09:03
before they would be gone and skyscrapers would stand in their place. "You don't know China," they said in
5:09:10
disbelief. I told them that they did not know the power of the economic arbitragees that would occur as a result
5:09:16
of opening up. While the opening up created a great natural opportunity, the Chinese made
5:09:23
the most of it and performed even beyond my highest expectations. They did that by making
5:09:29
and implementing Deng's reforms supported by uniquely Chinese cultural influences. The expressed goal that I
5:09:37
heard a lot of in those early days of reform was to break the iron rice bowl, which was to no longer provide
5:09:44
demotivating guaranteed employment and ensured basic benefits and replace them
5:09:50
with more incentive based compensation. Globalization also helped a lot. The world wanted to include
5:09:57
China. Deng was an eager learner and he directed his policymakers to learn from
5:10:04
outsiders in the same way that he did. He especially relied on Lee Kuan Yu of
5:10:09
Singapore and other leaders of the culturally aligned Asian tiger economies for advice. I remember a dinner with the
5:10:16
head of China's Mofftech, which was their Ministry of Commerce, in which he rattled off details about the operations
5:10:24
of Singapore's airport, including how long a passenger had to wait to get their bags at the baggage claim, how
5:10:30
Singapore achieved such great results, and how China was going to implement those practices itself.
5:10:38
Many years later, I had the opportunity to host Lee Kuan Yu at my house along with some other esteemed guests. We
5:10:45
asked him to share his thoughts about leaders of the present and past. We were eager to get his perspective because he
5:10:52
had known most of them over the last 50 years and was one of the greats himself.
5:10:57
Without hesitating, he said that Deng was the greatest leader of the 20th century. Why? Because he was smart and
5:11:05
wise and open-minded. He was extremely practical and he delivered great results
5:11:10
for his country of a billion people. While Deng formally stepped down
5:11:16
from the Pullet Bureau's standing committee in 1987, he remained the de facto leader of China which continued to
5:11:23
open up and become more capitalist at a breakneck pace. I played a small part in
5:11:28
its evolution over the years. In 1989, my sitic friend Wang Lee, who was
5:11:34
responsible for bond trading, introduced me to the group of people who along with her had been designated to create the
5:11:41
organization that would set up the first stock markets in the new China, the stock exchange executive council known
5:11:48
as SEK. They had been appointed by seven companies at the request of the visionary economic reformer and
5:11:55
historian Wong Chi. China was still very poor and Seek's
5:12:01
office was in a dingy hotel because the group lacked adequate funding. Still,
5:12:06
they had what mattered most, a clear mission to create big changes, smart people of good character,
5:12:13
open-mindedness to allow rapid learning, and determination to achieve their goals. This was not a job to them. It
5:12:20
was a noble mission to improve their country. I was thrilled to help them.
5:12:26
And over the decades that followed, I saw how they and many others built the Chinese financial markets to become
5:12:32
among the largest in the world. Then a shock happened that led
5:12:37
everyone to question just about everything. In 1989, a movement to
5:12:42
democratize China grew into the demonstrations that led to the crackdown known as the Tianan Square incident. The
5:12:50
leadership was split on how to handle the movement. Deng made the defining choice, which was to sideline the
5:12:57
liberal forces and go ahead with the conservatives crackdown. Most Chinese people I spoke
5:13:03
with at the time were worried that China would slip back into its old Mao gang of four type ways.
5:13:09
A very close friend from Sidic, Madame Guu, whose brother was China's minister
5:13:15
of defense, happened to be staying with my family at the time. So I saw events unfold through her eyes as well as
5:13:22
through the eyes of other Chinese friends. Madame Guu had been an idealistic follower of Mao in the early
5:13:28
years after liberation. When the cultural revolution came along, she lost her husband to
5:13:34
persecution and was shunned by friends. She got past that terrible experience to
5:13:40
work on behalf of the country she loved and rose to a senior job at Sitic. She
5:13:46
cried at the prospect of a return to those terrible old days. Tianaan Square
5:13:51
significantly set back most countries relationships with China, but it didn't keep Deng and his government from
5:13:58
continuing their reforms. Over time, most of my Chinese friends who were heartbroken about the
5:14:04
crackdown came to believe that the government had made the right move because their greatest fear was
5:14:10
revolutionary disorder. Over the next decade, the economy continued its strong growth and
5:14:17
relations and trade with the West became better than ever. Globalization, which
5:14:22
helped China immensely, can be said to have begun in 1995 with the formation of
5:14:27
the World Trade Organization. The epoch effectively ended with the election of Donald Trump in
5:14:35
2016. China joined the WTO in 2001 and its position in world trade soared. That
5:14:43
year, the United States had more trade than China with 80% of WTO member
5:14:48
countries. Now, China is a larger trading partner than the United States for about 70% of those countries.
5:14:57
During this period of globalization, a symbiotic relationship developed between China and the US in which the Chinese
5:15:04
manufactured consumer goods in an extremely cost-effective way and loaned
5:15:10
the US money to buy them. It was a hell of a buy now, pay later deal for the
5:15:15
Americans, and the Chinese liked it because they built their savings in the world's reserve currency.
5:15:21
It struck me as odd that the Chinese who were earning about a 40th of Americans on average would be lending money to
5:15:29
Americans since rich people are in a better position to lend than poor ones.
5:15:34
To me, it was a shocking reflection of how deeply Americans were willing to get into debt to finance their
5:15:40
overconumption and how much more the Chinese valued saving. It was also a
5:15:46
reflection of how emerging countries that want to save in the bonds and debt of the leading reserve currency
5:15:52
countries can lead those countries to become overind. In 1992, China's triangular
5:15:59
debt crisis came to a head. These were debt and economic problems that arose
5:16:04
from China's five major government-owned banks lending to large, inefficient, and unprofitable state-owned enterprises
5:16:12
with the implicit guarantee of the central government. Juang Ji, a bold
5:16:17
reformer at the top of the party, led the efforts to restructure the economy to become more efficient. This process
5:16:24
was extremely controversial and hurt a lot of people who had benefited from the old system. So it took a lot of courage
5:16:31
and intelligence as well as support from the top to execute. Best practices for example
5:16:38
using bad banks to take sell off and wind down the bad debts were used and
5:16:43
modified for the Chinese environment. J became premier in 1998 and in that
5:16:50
capacity continued to aggressively pursue reforms to modernize and make the Chinese economy more efficient until he
5:16:57
retired in 2003. Many of his former aids are among China's senior economic policy makers
5:17:05
today. In 1995, I sent my 11-year-old son, Matt, to China, where he lived with
5:17:12
Madame Guu and her husband and attended what was then a poor local school, Sha Xiaou Tong
5:17:18
Xiao. Matt had been to China with me many times since he was 3 years old and had gotten to know Madame Guu well. He
5:17:26
didn't speak the language, so he would have to learn through immersion, which he did. Though his school was poor, for
5:17:33
example, there wasn't heat until late November, so students wore their coats in class, it had smart and caring
5:17:40
teachers who provided the children with an excellent, complete education that included character
5:17:45
development. Though Matt was deprived of some comforts he was used to, he couldn't take hot showers because the
5:17:52
old apartment building he lived in only had hot water. two days a week, for example. He was superbly educated,
5:17:59
loved, and better developed than he would have been in our rich community. He built deep attachments with his
5:18:06
teachers and friends that still exist. The experience led him to set up a foundation to help Chinese orphans that
5:18:12
he ran for 12 years. Around that time, I also hired a Chinese team to invest
5:18:18
American institutional money in Chinese businesses. I pursued the effort for a couple of years but had to discontinue
5:18:25
it because I found it too difficult to run it and Bridgewater at the same time. In 1995 to96 it became widely
5:18:34
known that Deng's health was failing. Chinese leaders worried that his death would be viewed as an opportunity to
5:18:41
challenge Chinese authority. They were especially worried that the Taiwanese would hold a referendum in favor of
5:18:48
independence. President Lee Tengui, whom China regarded as a pro-independence leader,
5:18:54
had just made a controversial visit to the US shortly in advance of his nomination for Taiwan's 1996
5:19:02
presidential election. Madame Guu knew the Chinese official in charge of
5:19:07
relations with Taiwan and arranged for me to meet with him. He told me that
5:19:12
China would do anything, including going to war, to prevent Taiwanese independence.
5:19:17
should a new Chinese leader permit a referendum, he explained. The Chinese people would regard him as too weak to
5:19:24
lead. China had seen how Russia's brutal suppression of rebels in the Chchin Republic had led to reduced support for
5:19:31
independence. The Chinese hoped that a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait would similarly dampen Taiwan's
5:19:39
enthusiasm. In March 1996, President Bill Clinton, who was facing reelection, sent two
5:19:46
aircraft carriers into the Taiwan Strait. Further military movements and
5:19:51
threats on both sides followed. At the end of the day, the Taiwanese never held the referendum. So,
5:19:58
my Chinese friends thought their moves had been successful, while the Americans believed that they had humiliated the
5:20:04
Chinese, which I only recently found out from an American friend who was involved in the decision to send in the American
5:20:12
warships. As a result of the third Taiwan Strait crisis, the Chinese
5:20:17
significantly built up their military capabilities in the region. I point this out to convey a how important Taiwan's
5:20:25
reunification with China is and b how risky the situation was 25 years ago
5:20:31
when China was not nearly as strong militarily as it is now. In short, I
5:20:36
would worry a lot if we were to see a fourth Taiwan Strait crisis. Deng died on February 19th,
5:20:45
1997, having transformed China almost beyond recognition. When he came to
5:20:51
power, 90% of the population lived in extreme poverty. At the time of his
5:20:56
death, that number had fallen by more than half. And as of the most recent data is below
5:21:02
1%. From the start of his reforms in 1978 until his death in 1997, the
5:21:09
Chinese economy grew at an average rate of 10% a year, sexupling in size while
5:21:15
experiencing an average inflation rate of just 8%. Its reserves grew from $4 billion to
5:21:22
nearly $150 billion. Inflation adjusted to today's dollars, its reserves grew by
5:21:28
over $250 billion. Those reserves covered 60% of
5:21:34
annual imports in 1978. By 1998, they covered more than
5:21:40
125% of imports and nearly 800% of foreign debt service.
5:21:46
Dengs successors, Jeang Zamin and Huin Tao and their teams continued the
5:21:52
reforms and the advances through many ups and downs, though more ups than
5:21:57
downs. In 1997, the Asian financial crisis came along. With Ju Rang Xi
5:22:04
assigned to run the effort, China did a very successful debt and corporate restructuring which included sales of
5:22:11
unprofitable state-owned enterprises, the building up of exports and foreign
5:22:16
exchange reserves, a crackdown on corruption, and the further development and improvement of markets and market
5:22:22
functioning. These and other changes were all important evolutionary steps. I
5:22:28
felt lucky to be intimately involved at the grassroots level with some of them. For example, the debt restructuring and
5:22:35
asset sales. Though these events seemed bigger at the time than they appear in retrospect, they were all significant
5:22:42
achievements. I also ran into cases of corruption and bad behavior and witnessed closeup the ongoing struggle
5:22:49
between the good and the bad that led to further reforms. As is typical of post-war
5:22:56
periods of peace and prosperity, when the leading power isn't threatened and emerging countries aren't yet
5:23:02
threatening, emerging countries can learn a lot from the leading powers as they work together in a symbiotic way
5:23:09
until the emerging power becomes powerful enough to threaten the leading power. In addition to benefiting from
5:23:16
the learning, they benefit from trading with each other until that becomes disadvantageous. And they benefit from
5:23:23
using the capital markets to their mutual benefit until that becomes disadvantageous.
5:23:30
More specifically, the 1978 to 2008 period of fast growth in China came
5:23:36
about because one, the world was still in the peace and prosperity phase of the big cycle in which globalization and
5:23:43
capitalism that is the belief that goods and services should be produced wherever
5:23:49
is most coste effective. There should be free flows of talented people without prejudice toward their nationalities.
5:23:56
nationalism is bad and global equal opportunity and profit-seeking capitalism are good were understood to
5:24:04
be the widely accepted paths to a better world while at the same time two Deng
5:24:10
Xiaoping swung the pendulum from communist and isolationist policies that worked terribly to market state
5:24:18
capitalist and open door policies that worked terrifically. That led China to
5:24:24
learn a lot, attract a lot of foreign capital, and become a giant exporter and
5:24:29
big saver. As the Chinese became more capable of producing cost effectively,
5:24:35
they provided the world with inexpensive goods at first and more advanced goods later, becoming much richer in the
5:24:43
process. Other emerging countries did so as well. The world expanded and the
5:24:48
wealth gaps between the richest countries and the poorest countries narrowed as the poorest countries rose
5:24:54
the most while the richest countries grew at slower rates. These circumstances lifted most boats
5:25:01
especially the boats of the global elites. China rose to be a nearly comparable power to the United States
5:25:09
and together they created most of the world's new wealth and new technologies. Europe, which had been the
5:25:15
source of the greatest global powers from the 15th to the 20th centuries, became relatively weak, and Japan and
5:25:23
Russia became secondary powers. All other countries were peripheral. While emerging countries
5:25:30
like India improved their conditions, none of them achieved world power status.
5:25:38
Phase three, the emergence of US China conflicts and the end of globalization
5:25:44
2008 to present. As is classic, periods of
5:25:49
prosperity financed by debt growth lead to debt bubbles and large wealth gaps.
5:25:55
In the US, the bubble burst in 2008 as it did in 1929 and the world economy
5:26:02
contracted and middle class Americans and those in other countries were hurt as in 1929
5:26:09
to32. Interest rates were pushed down to 0% as in 1931, which still wasn't enough
5:26:15
easing. So central banks printed a lot of money and bought a lot of financial assets after 2008 like in 1934 which
5:26:24
drove up their prices in most countries starting in 2009 as happened in 1933 to
5:26:31
36. This benefited the halves people who had financial assets more than the
5:26:37
have-s without them. So the wealth gaps grew wider still as they did in the
5:26:43
1933-38 period. The have nots, especially those whose jobs were being
5:26:48
taken by the Chinese and immigrants, began to rise up against the elites who were benefiting from
5:26:55
globalization. As is typically the case when economic bad times coincide with
5:27:00
large wealth gaps, populism and nationalism grew around the world, as
5:27:05
they also did in the 1930s. That is when the threat the rising powers pose becomes more apparent
5:27:12
to the leading powers. The era of peace, prosperity, and globalization began to
5:27:18
wne, giving way to an era of conflicts between the rich and the poor within
5:27:23
countries and between the rising country, China, and the dominant world power, the
5:27:29
US. The Chinese were holding a lot of US dollar denominated debt, especially from
5:27:35
US government agency lenders Fanny May and Freddy Mack. For quite a while, the
5:27:40
US government didn't let the Chinese holders of this debt know whether it would stand behind it. I had
5:27:47
conversations with top Chinese holders of this debt, as did David McCormack, who is now CEO of Bridgewater and was
5:27:54
the US Treasury's under secretary for international affairs at the time, and Hank Pollson, who was the US Treasury
5:28:01
Secretary. We were all impressed with the consideration and cooperation with
5:28:06
which the Chinese approached the dilemma that the US had caused them. They were calm, empathetic, and
5:28:13
cooperative. In November 2008, leaders of the G20 countries gathered in
5:28:18
Washington DC and agreed to jointly stimulate their economies through aggressive fiscal and monetary policies.
5:28:26
These required a substantial increase of government debt which was financed by having central banks create more money
5:28:32
and credit. Debt growth in China was significantly faster than economic
5:28:37
growth between 2009 and 2012 as a result of those
5:28:44
policies. Becoming a world power in 2012 Jinping came to power and
5:28:52
a new administration was chosen. Following the wellestablished sequence, first pullet bureau members were chosen,
5:28:59
then ministers, vice ministers, and their senior subordinates. Then the first rounds of
5:29:05
plans were made. As when most new leaders take power, there was a lot of
5:29:11
excitement and an eagerness to strengthen both the rule of law by purging corruption and China's economy
5:29:17
by strengthening and adding to its market-based reforms. There were a number of brainstorming
5:29:23
sessions and I was lucky enough to participate in a few. They were wonderful collaborations of people with
5:29:30
different perspectives who wanted to help. The frankness, open-mindedness, friendliness, and intelligence that they
5:29:36
brought to the table was remarkable. Since then, I have closely followed
5:29:42
China's financial and economic circumstances and have had numerous conversations with its top economic
5:29:48
policy makers about such matters as excessive debt growth, the development and management of their shadow banking
5:29:54
system, the vulnerabilities in their financial systems, their trade disputes with the US, and more. I always tried to
5:30:02
see things from their perspective and think about what I would do if I were in their shoes. I shared what I saw with
5:30:09
them as frankly as a doctor discussing a medical case with colleagues in much the same way as I'm sharing it with you in
5:30:15
this audio book. I never ask questions that put them in the awkward position of having
5:30:21
to choose between conveying confidential information and having to decline my request. I make it clear at all times
5:30:28
that my sole desire is to understand and help. As you probably know by now, I
5:30:35
believe that everything works like a machine with timeless and universal cause effect relationships. Chinese
5:30:42
leaders do too, so we almost always came to similar conclusions. Over the years, theQI
5:30:49
administration has aggressively pursued policies to reform and open up its markets and its economy, manage its debt
5:30:56
growth, more flexibly, manage its currency, support entrepreneurship and
5:31:01
marketoriented decision-making, especially in industries that China wants to be world leaders in. Establish
5:31:08
sensible regulations run by well-developed regulatory organizations. Build its capabilities in the
5:31:14
technologies and industries of the future. broaden the economic benefits extended to the people and regions that
5:31:21
were lagging the most and control pollution and environmental degradation. Yet many people don't see
5:31:28
it that way, which I suspect is because a the reforms are coming at the same time as other controls are tightening
5:31:35
up. B. Some of the supports like credit availability for small and medium-siz
5:31:41
organizations are not as good as they are for larger state-owned enterprises, which has more to do with technical
5:31:48
challenges than any reduced desire to foster the development of small and medium-siz
5:31:53
organizations. C. The government directs the economy from the top down, sometimes
5:31:59
expecting banks and companies to make uneconomic loans because it wants to do what is best for the country as a whole.
5:32:06
D. China coordinates with its businesses in pursuit of national goals. E, it
5:32:12
doesn't let some foreign companies operate on the same terms as Chinese companies. and F, it coordinates fiscal
5:32:19
and monetary policy to regulate the economy much more than is done in the major reserve currency countries, all of
5:32:26
which are typically unpopular with capitalist outsiders. Certainly, many Americans are
5:32:33
critical of these policies. While I won't delve into the merits of them, I will say that we should expect all
5:32:39
countries leaders to try to get the best balance between state government influence and control of the economy and
5:32:47
capitalism, free market control of the economy and capital markets through the
5:32:52
proper management and coordination of monetary and fiscal policies and we should try to understand the thinking
5:32:58
behind their approaches. For example, PresidentQi has said he wants to A reduce the government's role
5:33:05
in pricing and allocating resources, develop the capital markets, and stimulate entrepreneurship while also b
5:33:14
strongly directing the macroeconomy and regulating markets and other aspects of life to be what he and the party believe
5:33:21
are best for most Chinese. In other words, he wants a mix of capitalism and Marxist communism.
5:33:28
This is understandably confusing to those who aren't used to seeing capitalism and communism go together,
5:33:34
aren't watching closely, and haven't spoken with the policymakers to understand their circumstances and
5:33:40
perspectives. So, they can't see the consistencies that exist amid the seemingly great inconsistencies, that is
5:33:47
the dialectics as Markx and the Chinese leaders would call them. To understand their circumstances and
5:33:54
perspectives, I suggest that you not view what they are doing through stereotypes, for example, of what
5:34:00
communists do and accept that they are trying and will continue to try to
5:34:06
juggle these two seemingly inconsistent things. In their view, capitalism is a
5:34:11
way of raising the living standards of most people and is not meant to serve capitalists. Whether one thinks this
5:34:18
approach is good or bad, their results have been extremely impressive. So we should not expect the Chinese to abandon
5:34:25
it for an American or Western approach. Rather, we should study it to see what
5:34:30
we can learn from it the same way that the Chinese have studied and learned from the West. After all, what we have
5:34:37
is a competition of approaches that we need to understand in order to play this competitive game
5:34:44
well. As far as foreign policy is concerned, China has become stronger and
5:34:49
more forceful, while the United States has become more confrontational. More specifically, from
5:34:55
2012 until the time of my writing, China's strengths have grown, which has become increasingly apparent and more
5:35:02
openly shown. For example, the Made in China 2025 plan trumpets its plans to
5:35:08
dominate certain industries that the United States currently controls. This has sparked a strong reaction in
5:35:14
the US which became most evident after the election of Donald Trump in
5:35:21
2016. Trump tapped into the resentments of those left behind by globalization
5:35:26
who believed that China was unfairly competing and stealing their jobs and nurtured a new spirit of protectionism
5:35:33
and nationalism. It wasn't just Trump. China's strength had become a
5:35:39
provocation for more moderate policymakers. as well. Where there had been synergy, there was now raw
5:35:47
competition. Basically, China does not want to be contained and the United States and some other countries want to
5:35:54
contain it. What does that mean geopolitically? As you know by now,
5:35:59
countries boundaries have constantly changed over time. They are often in dispute and international law isn't
5:36:06
worth a hill of beans relative to power in resolving these disputes. In 2009,
5:36:12
China declared to the United Nations that it has indisputable sovereignty over an area in the East and South China
5:36:20
seas. The area is marked by a 9- line on a World War II era map presented by
5:36:26
China. It covers offshore waters east of Vietnam, north of Malaysia, and west of
5:36:32
the Philippines, which include a bunch of islands, are important for shipping that China needs, and are believed to
5:36:39
have undiscovered oil reserves, which I imagine China would love to have given its huge imported oil needs, and the
5:36:46
risk of oil imports from the Middle East being cut off. If you listened to the World War II case
5:36:52
study in chapter 6 and saw how the US cut off resources to Japan, you know the
5:36:58
issue. China has a great need for oil and other imports that currently come
5:37:03
through a choke point at the Strait of Mala. As a result of all of this and
5:37:09
other assertions, the perception of China as a threat or enemy has emerged,
5:37:14
globalization has reversed, and wars have intensified, starting with the
5:37:19
trade and economic wars, expanding to the technology and the geopolitical wars, and most recently to the capital
5:37:27
war. All remain relatively mild in relation to what they could be, but they
5:37:32
should be watched closely. Eventually, the actual powers of a country that are recognized become consistent with the
5:37:39
actual powers that exist. The actual powers that exist are reflected in the
5:37:44
gauges and other facts that I'm watching for guidance. China has continued to grow
5:37:51
internally and to expand its investment and business activities outside its borders. It has invested heavily in the
5:37:58
developing world most notably through the belt and road initiative which extends through central Asia starting
5:38:04
with the countries on its border Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan to Europe and through the
5:38:12
Arabian Peninsula and South Asia into the Mediterranean and Africa. The
5:38:18
amounts invested and earmarked for investment are enormous, the largest such program since the Marshall Plan. It
5:38:26
is a good demonstration that wealth equals power. While these moves have been
5:38:31
appreciated by the countries that received the benefits from roads and other infrastructure, resources, and
5:38:38
trade, they have also sparked resentments from recipient countries who were having problems paying back their
5:38:44
loans and find that China is too controlling and from the United States because China's assertions of soft power
5:38:51
have lessened American influence in those countries. As far as China's internal politics are
5:38:58
concerned, in 2018,Qi A consolidated power around
5:39:03
himself and his supporters called the core leadership. B amended the Chinese
5:39:09
constitution to make it clear that the Chinese Communist Party has control over everything. C eliminated term limits for
5:39:17
the president and vice president. D created supervisory commissions to
5:39:22
ensure that government officials are operating consistently with the party's wishes and E enshrined cheese
5:39:29
perspective called chiinping thought into the constitution. As of this writing big
5:39:36
political changes, increased controls and wider distribution of wealth are all
5:39:42
underway. Some people are concerned that she is becoming more autocratic than Mao. I'm no expert on Chinese politics,
5:39:50
so I don't have much to offer when it comes to China's internal political matters. But I will pass along what I am
5:39:56
told, which is that Chi's controversial moves to tighten his control came about
5:40:01
because of the belief that China is entering a more difficult phase in a more challenging world, and that at such
5:40:08
times, unity and continuity of leadership are especially important, and that will be the case even more over the
5:40:15
next few years. As mentioned earlier, during periods of great crisis, more
5:40:20
autocratic and less democratic leadership tends to be preferred.
5:40:26
Then in late 2019, the CO 19 pandemic began in China, sparking a worldwide
5:40:32
economic downturn in 2020 and the massive printing and creation of money and credit which coincided with various
5:40:40
types of conflicts in the US. Most obviously protests related to racial injustice and a very contentious
5:40:47
presidential campaign. That brings us up to today. Looking back over the last four
5:40:54
decades, China's shift from isolation to opening up and from hardcore communism
5:41:00
to market reforms and capitalism have had a greater impact on the economies of
5:41:05
China, the US, and the rest of the world than anything else. China transition
5:41:11
from one of the most backward countries in the world to one of the two most powerful economically, technologically,
5:41:18
militarily, and geopolitically. Most of that progress occurred during an
5:41:23
era of peace and prosperity when the leading empire wasn't threatened and globalization and cooperation
5:41:30
flourished. The period lasted until the bursting of the debt bubble in 2008 when
5:41:35
the United States and much of the rest of the world became more nationalistic, protectionist, and confrontational
5:41:42
following the archetypical big cycle progression. The results of China's reform and
5:41:48
opening up are reflected in the next PDF table which shows just a few representative statistics. Output per
5:41:56
person has increased 25 times. The percentage of people living below the poverty line has fallen from 96% to less
5:42:04
than 1%. Life expectancy has increased by an average of about 10 years. And the
5:42:10
average number of years of education has increased by 80%. I could go on and on rattling off
5:42:16
equally impressive statistics in virtually every area. While the indicators of China's
5:42:23
rise are broadly representative, they aren't precise because the powers can't be precisely measured. Take education
5:42:31
for example. While our index for education rises at a fairly brisk pace,
5:42:36
it fails to fully capture the relative improvements in China because it is made up of average as well as total levels of
5:42:44
education. This distortion is best conveyed in the next table. As you can see, while the average education level
5:42:51
in China is considerably below the average education level in the US, China's total number of people who have
5:42:58
attained higher level education is significantly greater than the United States. Its total number of STEM,
5:43:05
science, technology, engineering, and math graduates is about three times the
5:43:10
United States. At the same time, there are reasons to believe that the average quality of
5:43:16
Chinese education isn't as high, especially at the college level. For example, in a recent ranking, only two
5:43:23
Chinese universities appeared among the top 50 universities in the world. Chin
5:43:28
Wa University at number 29 and Ping University at number 49, while 30
5:43:34
American universities did. This picture in which the average of something in China is below the average
5:43:41
of the same thing in the United States but the total in China is greater than the total in the US is because the
5:43:48
average level of development in China is lower while the Chinese population is more than four times as large as the
5:43:55
American population. That comes across in a number of stats. For example, while
5:44:01
the United States is militarily stronger in total all over the world, the Chinese
5:44:06
appear to be militarily stronger in the East and South China Seas area. And
5:44:11
there is a lot that is unknown about both countries military powers because they are kept secret. See the next PDF
5:44:19
table. In conclusion, this modern era for China
5:44:24
has led to some of the most rapid improvements in basic living conditions in history, as well as an obvious climb
5:44:30
in the factors that create powerful empires. In all respects, China is now a
5:44:36
major and expanding power. Next, we will turn to the US China relationship in light of where it
5:44:43
is now and what matters most to Americans and the Chinese.
Chapter 13: US-China Relations and Wars
5:44:50
Chapter 13, US China relations and
5:44:55
wars. In this chapter, I will be looking at the positions that the US and China now find themselves in and what being in
5:45:02
these positions means for USChina relations. Because the US and China are
5:45:08
now rival powers in a number of domains, they are in conflicts or wars in these
5:45:13
domains. So I will be looking at where these stand because for the most part
5:45:18
these are just new versions of old and classic conflicts. For example, new technologies in a classic technology
5:45:25
war, new weapons in a classic military war, etc. I will be putting them in the
5:45:31
context of what has happened repeatedly in history and with the timeless and universal principles we have learned
5:45:37
from studying these cases. While I will explore the range of possibilities that
5:45:42
one might consider, I will be doing that without getting into what the future might look like. I will do that in the
5:45:50
concluding chapter of this audio book. In this chapter, I will also be moving a
5:45:55
bit more from just conveying facts to sharing opinions, that is sharing my
5:46:00
uncertain conjectures. I am primarily focusing on US China
5:46:06
relations in this chapter. But in truth, the game macro investors and global
5:46:11
policy makers are playing is like multi-dimensional chess that requires each player to consider the many
5:46:17
positions and possible moves of a number of key players that is countries that
5:46:22
are also playing the game. With each of these players having a wide range of considerations, economic, political,
5:46:29
military, etc. that they have to weigh to make their moves. Well, the relevant
5:46:35
other players that are now in this multi-dimensional game include Russia, Japan, India, and other Asian countries,
5:46:43
Australia, and European countries. And all of them have many considerations and
5:46:48
constituents that will determine their moves. From playing the game I play, global macro investing, I know how
5:46:56
complicated it is to simultaneously consider all that is relevant in order to make winning decisions. I also know
5:47:03
that what I do is not as complicated as what those in the seats of power do. And I know that I don't have access to
5:47:10
information that is as good as what they have. So, it would be arrogant for me to think I know better than they do about
5:47:17
what's going on and how to best handle it. For those reasons, I am offering my
5:47:22
views with humility. With that equivocation, I will tell you how I see the USChina relationship and the world
5:47:29
setting in light of these wars. And I will be brutally
5:47:35
honest. The positions the Americans and Chinese are in. As I see it, destiny and the big
5:47:43
cycle manifestations of it have put these two countries and their leaders in the positions they are now in. They led
5:47:50
the United States to go through its mutually reinforcing big cycle successes which led to excesses that led to
5:47:56
weakening in a number of areas. Similarly, they led China to go through its big cycle declines which led to
5:48:04
intolerably bad conditions that led to revolutionary changes and to the mutually reinforcing upswings that China
5:48:11
is now in. So the United States appears to be in decline and China appears to be
5:48:17
on the rise for all the classic reasons. Destiny and the big debt cycle
5:48:23
led the US to find itself now in the late cycle phase of the long-term debt cycle in which it has too much debt and
5:48:31
needs to rapidly produce much more debt which it can't service with hard currency. So, it has to monetize its
5:48:38
debt in the classic late cycle way of printing money to fund the government's deficits. Ironically and classically,
5:48:46
being in this bad position is the consequence of the United States successes leading to these excesses. For
5:48:53
example, it is because of the United States great global successes that the US dollar became the world's dominant
5:49:00
reserve currency, which allowed Americans to borrow excessively from the rest of the world, including from China,
5:49:07
which put the US in the tenuous position of owing other countries, including China, a lot of money, which has put
5:49:14
those other countries in the tenuous position of holding the debt of an overly indebted country that is rapidly
5:49:21
increasing and monetizing. ing its debt and it pays significantly negative real
5:49:26
interest rates to those holding its debt. In other words, it is because of the classic reserve currency cycle that
5:49:33
China wanted to save a lot in the world's reserve currency which led it to lend so much to Americans who wanted to
5:49:40
borrow so much which has put the Chinese and the Americans in this awkward big debtor creditor relationship when these
5:49:48
wars are going on between them. Destiny and the way the wealth cycle
5:49:53
works, especially under capitalism, led to incentives and resources being put
5:49:58
into place that allowed Americans to make great advances and produce great wealth and eventually created the large
5:50:05
wealth gaps that are now causing conflicts and threatening the domestic order and productivity that is required
5:50:11
for the US to stay strong. In China, it was the classic collapse of its finances
5:50:17
due to debt and money weaknesses, internal conflicts, and conflicts with foreign powers that led to its big cycle
5:50:24
financial declines at the same time that the US was ascending. And it was the extremity of these terrible conditions
5:50:32
that produced the revolutionary changes that eventually led to the creation of incentives and market capitalist
5:50:38
approaches that produced China's great advances, great wealth, and the large wealth gaps that it is understandably
5:50:45
increasingly concerned about. Similarly, destiny and the way the
5:50:50
global power cycle works have now put the United States in the unfortunate position of having to choose between
5:50:56
fighting to defend its position and its existing world order or retreating. For
5:51:02
example, it is because the United States won the war in the Pacific in World War II that it rather than any other country
5:51:09
will have to choose between defending Taiwan, most Americans don't know where in the world it is or how to spell it,
5:51:16
or retreating. It is because of that destiny and that global power cycle that
5:51:21
the United States now has military bases in more than 70 countries in order to
5:51:27
defend its world order, even though it is uneconomical to do so.
5:51:32
History has shown that all countries success depends on sustaining the strengthening forces without producing
5:51:39
the excesses that lead to count's declines. The really successful countries have been able to do that in a
5:51:46
big way for 200 to 300 years. No country has been able to do it forever.
5:51:53
Thus far, we've looked at the history of the last 500 years, focusing especially on the rise and decline cycles of the
5:52:00
Dutch, British, and American reserve currency empires, and briefly at the last 1,400 years of China's dynasties,
5:52:08
which has brought us up to the present. The goal has been to put where we are in the context of the big picture stories
5:52:14
that got us here and to see the cause effect patterns of how things work so that we can put where we are into better
5:52:22
perspective. Now we need to drop down and look at where we are in more detail
5:52:28
hopefully without losing sight of that big picture. As we drop down, things that
5:52:33
seem imperceptibly small in retrospect. Huawei, Hong Kong sanctions, closing
5:52:39
consulates, moving battleships, unprecedented monetary policies, political fights, social conflicts, and
5:52:46
many others will at the time appear much larger, and we will find ourselves in
5:52:51
the blizzard of them that comes at us every day. Each warrants more than a chapter long
5:52:57
examination which I don't intend to do here but I will touch on the major
5:53:03
issues. History has taught us that there are five major types of wars. One trade
5:53:10
economic wars, two technology wars, three geopolitical wars, four capital
5:53:18
wars and five military wars. To these I would add six culture wars
5:53:25
and seven the war with ourselves. While all sensible people wish that these wars weren't occurring
5:53:32
and instead that cooperation was happening, we must be practical in recognizing that they exist. We should
5:53:39
use past cases in history and our understandings of actual developments as they're taking place to think about what
5:53:47
is most likely to happen next and how to deal with it well. We see these wars transpiring in varying
5:53:54
degrees. Now they should not be mistaken for individual conflicts but rather
5:54:00
recognized as interrelated conflicts that are extensions of one bigger evolving conflict. In watching them
5:54:07
transpire, we need to observe and try to understand each side's strategic goals.
5:54:13
For example, are they trying to hasten a conflict, which some Americans think is
5:54:18
best for the US because time is on China's side because China is growing its strength at a faster pace? Or are
5:54:26
they trying to ease the conflicts because they believe that they would be better off if there is no war? In order
5:54:33
to prevent these conflicts from escalating out of control, it will be important for leaders of both countries
5:54:40
to be clear about what the red lines and trip wires are that signal changes in
5:54:45
the seriousness of the conflict. Let's now take a look at these
5:54:50
wars with the lessons from history and the principles they provide in mind.
5:54:57
The trade economic war. Like all wars, the trade war can go
5:55:03
from being a polite dispute to being life-threatening depending on how far the combatants want to take
5:55:09
it. Thus far, we haven't seen the US China trade war taken very far. It
5:55:15
features classic tariffs and import restrictions that are reminiscent of those we have repeatedly seen in other
5:55:21
similar periods of conflict. For example, the Smoot Holly Tariff Act of
5:55:26
1930. We have seen the trade negotiations and what they achieved reflected in a very limited phase 1
5:55:33
trade agreement from 2019 that was tentatively implemented. As we have
5:55:38
seen, this negotiation was about testing each other's powers rather than looking to global laws and judges like the World
5:55:46
Trade Organization to achieve fair resolution. Tests of power are how all these wars
5:55:52
will be fought. The big question is how far these tests of power will go and
5:55:58
what form will they take. Beyond the trade dispute, there are three major economic criticisms the
5:56:05
US has about China's handling of its economy. One, the Chinese government pursues a
5:56:12
wide range of evolving interventionist policies and practices aimed at limiting
5:56:17
market access for imported goods, services, and businesses, thus protecting its domestic industries by
5:56:23
creating unfair practices. Two, the Chinese offer significant
5:56:29
government guidance, resources, and regulatory support to Chinese industries, most notably including
5:56:35
policies designed to extract advanced technologies from foreign companies, particularly in sensitive
5:56:43
sectors. Three, the Chinese are stealing intellectual property with some of this
5:56:48
stealing believed to be state sponsored and some of it believed to be outside the government's direct control.
5:56:56
Generally speaking, the United States has responded both by trying to alter what the Chinese are doing, for example,
5:57:02
to get them to open their markets to Americans, and by doing its own versions of these things, closing American
5:57:09
markets to the Chinese. Americans won't admit to doing some of the things they are doing, for example, taking
5:57:16
intellectual property any more than the Chinese will admit to doing them because the public relations costs of admitting
5:57:23
to doing them are too great. When they are looking for supporters of their causes, all leaders want to appear to be
5:57:30
the leaders of the army that is fighting for good against the evil army that is doing bad things. That is why we hear
5:57:37
accusations from both sides that the other is doing evil things and no disclosures of the similar things that
5:57:44
they are doing. When things are going well, it is easy to keep the moral high ground.
5:57:50
However, when the fighting gets tough, it becomes easier to justify doing that which was previously considered immoral.
5:57:57
Though rather than calling it immoral, it is called moral. As the fighting becomes tougher, a
5:58:04
dichotomy emerges between the idealistic descriptions of what is being done, which is good for public relations
5:58:11
within the country, and the practical things that are being done to win. That
5:58:16
is because in wars, leaders want to convince their constituents that we are good and they are evil because that is
5:58:23
the most effective way to rally people's support. In some cases, to the point that they are willing to kill or die for
5:58:29
the cause. Though true, it is not easy to inspire people if a practical leader
5:58:35
explains that there are no laws in war other than the ethical laws people
5:58:40
impose on themselves. And we have to play by the same rules they play by or
5:58:45
we will stupidly fight by self-imposing that we do it with one hand behind our backs.
5:58:52
I believe that we've pretty much seen the best trade agreement that we are going to see and that the risks of this
5:58:58
war worsening are greater than the likelihood that they will lessen and that we won't see any treaty or tariff
5:59:04
changes anytime soon from the Biden administration. Whatever approach they
5:59:09
eventually take will be a big influence on how Americans and the Chinese approach the big cycle destinies that
5:59:16
are in the process of unfolding. As it now stands, the one thing, maybe the
5:59:21
only thing that both US political parties agree on is being hawkish on China. How hawkish and how exactly that
5:59:29
hawkishness is expressed and reacted to by the Chinese are now
5:59:35
unknown. How could this war worsen? Classically, the most dangerous
5:59:40
part of the trade economic war comes when countries cut others off from essential imports. The case study of the
5:59:48
US and Japan leading up to World War II found in chapter 6 is a useful analog to
5:59:54
US China circumstances because the geographies and the issues are analogous. For example, the US cutting
6:00:01
off China's imports of oil, other needed commodities, technologies, and/or other
6:00:07
essential imports from the US or other countries would be clear and obvious signs of the war escalating.
6:00:14
Likewise, China could escalate by cutting off companies like General Motors, which sells more cars in China
6:00:20
than in the US, and Apple, or cutting off US imports of rare earth elements
6:00:26
that are needed for the production of lots of high techch items, automobile engines, and defense systems. I'm not
6:00:33
saying such moves are likely, but I do want to be clear that moves to cut off essential imports from either side would
6:00:40
signal a major escalation that could lead to a much worse conflict. If that doesn't happen,
6:00:47
evolution will take its normal course. So, international balances of payments will evolve primarily based on each
6:00:53
country's evolving competitiveness. For these reasons, both countries,
6:00:59
especially China, are shifting to more domestic production and decoupling. Decoupling, while required
6:01:06
given the circumstances, will be difficult and will lead to significantly reduced efficiency. China's main program
6:01:14
for building self-sufficiency goes under the name of dual circulation. One knowledgeable party
6:01:20
described it as a compartmented rather than broad-based decoupling, which makes
6:01:25
sense to me. As PresidentQi has said, the world is undergoing changes not seen in a
6:01:32
century. And in the face of an external environment characterized by rising
6:01:38
protectionism, global economic downturn, and a shrinking international market,
6:01:43
China must give full play to the advantage of a huge domestic market. Over the last 40 years, it has
6:01:50
acquired the abilities to do this. Over the next 5 years, we should see both
6:01:55
countries become more independent from each other. The rate of reducing one's dependencies that can be cut off will be
6:02:02
much greater for China over the next 5 to 10 years than for the United States.
6:02:10
The technology war. The technology war is much more
6:02:15
serious than the trade economic war because whoever wins the technology war will probably also win the military wars
6:02:22
and all the other wars. The US and China are now the dominant players in the world's big tech
6:02:29
sectors. And these big tech sectors are the industries of the future. The Chinese tech sector has rapidly
6:02:36
developed domestically to serve the Chinese in China and to become a competitor in world markets. At the same
6:02:43
time, China remains highly dependent on technologies from the United States and other countries. That makes the United
6:02:51
States vulnerable to the increased development and competition of Chinese technologies and makes the Chinese
6:02:57
vulnerable to being cut off from essential technologies. The United States appears now to have
6:03:04
greater technology abilities overall, though it varies by type of technology and the US is losing its lead. For
6:03:12
example, while the US is ahead in advanced AI chip development, it is behind in 5G. As an imperfect reflection
6:03:20
of the present stage of the US's advantage, the market capitalizations of US tech companies in total are about
6:03:28
four times the size of China's. This calculation understates China's relative
6:03:33
strength because it doesn't include some of the big private companies like Huawei and Ant Group and the non-co company
6:03:40
that is government technology developments which are larger in China than they are in the United States. The
6:03:47
largest public Chinese tech companies, Tencent and Alibaba, are already the
6:03:52
seventh and eighth largest technology companies in the world, right behind some of the largest US quote unquote F
6:04:00
AMG stocks. Some of the most important technology areas are being led by the
6:04:06
Chinese. Consider that 40% of the world's largest civilian supercomputers
6:04:11
are now in China and it is leading in some dimensions of the AI big data race
6:04:16
and some dimensions of the quantum computing encryption communications race. Similar leads in other
6:04:23
technologies exist such as in fintech where the volume of e-commerce transactions and mobile-based payments
6:04:30
in China is the highest in the world and well ahead of that in the US. There are
6:04:36
likely technologies that even the US's most informed intelligence services don't know about that are being
6:04:42
developed in secret. China will probably advance its technologies and the quality of
6:04:48
decision-m that is enabled by them faster than the US will because big data
6:04:53
plus big AI plus big computing equals superior decision-m.
6:04:59
The Chinese are collecting vastly more data per person than is collected in the US and they have more than four times as
6:05:06
many people and they are investing heavily in AI and big computing to make the most of it. The amount of resources
6:05:14
that are being poured into these and other technology areas is far greater than those in the US. As for providing
6:05:21
money, both venture capitalists and the government are providing virtually unlimited amounts to Chinese developers.
6:05:28
As for providing people, the number of science, technology, engineering, and math STEM graduates that are coming out
6:05:36
of college and pursuing tech careers in China, is about eight times that in the
6:05:41
US. The United States has an overall technology lead, though it is behind in
6:05:46
some areas, and of course has some big hubs for new innovations, especially in its top universities and its big tech
6:05:53
companies. While the US isn't out of the game, its relative position is declining
6:05:59
because China's technological innovation abilities are improving at a faster pace. Remember that China is a country
6:06:06
whose leaders 37 years ago marveled at the handheld calculators I gave them.
6:06:12
Imagine where they might be 37 years from now. To fight the technology threats, the
6:06:19
United States has responded at times by preventing Chinese companies like Huawei
6:06:24
from operating in the United States, trying to undermine their usage internationally and possibly hurting
6:06:30
their viability through sanctions that prevent them from getting items needed for production. Is the United States doing
6:06:37
that because China is using these companies to spy in the United States and elsewhere? because the United States
6:06:44
is worried about them and other Chinese technology companies being more competitive and or because they are
6:06:50
retaliating for the Chinese not allowing American tech companies to have free access to the Chinese
6:06:56
market. While that is debatable, there is no doubt that these and other Chinese
6:07:01
companies are becoming more competitive at a fast pace. In response to this competitive threat, the United States is
6:07:08
moving to contain or kill threatening tech companies. Interestingly, while the United States
6:07:14
is cutting off access to intellectual property now, it would have had a much greater power to do so not long ago
6:07:21
because the United States had so much more intellectual property relative to others. China has started to do the same
6:07:28
to the United States, which will increasingly hurt because Chinese IP is becoming better in many ways.
6:07:36
Regarding the stealing of technologies, while it is generally agreed to be a big threat, it does not fully explain
6:07:44
actions taken against Chinese tech companies. One in five North American-based companies in a 2019 CNBC
6:07:52
Global CFO Council survey claimed to have had intellectual property stolen by
6:07:58
Chinese companies. If a company is breaking a law within a country, for example, Huawei in the US,
6:08:06
one would expect to see that crime prosecuted legally so one could see the evidence that shows the spying devices
6:08:13
embedded within the technologies. We aren't seeing this. Fear of growing competitiveness is as
6:08:20
large or larger a motivator of the attacks on Chinese technology companies,
6:08:25
but one can't expect policymakers to say that. American leaders can't admit that
6:08:31
the competitiveness of US technology is slipping and can't argue against allowing free competition to the
6:08:37
American people who for ages have been taught to believe that competition is both fair and the best process for
6:08:44
producing the best results. Stealing intellectual property has been going on for as long as there
6:08:51
has been recorded history and has always been difficult to prevent. As we saw in
6:08:56
earlier chapters, the British did it to the Dutch and the Americans did it to the British. Stealing implies breaking a
6:09:04
law. When the war is between countries, there are no laws, judges, or juries to
6:09:10
resolve disputes, and the real reasons decisions are made aren't always disclosed by those who are making them.
6:09:16
I don't mean to imply that the reasons behind the United States aggressive actions are not good ones. I don't know
6:09:23
if they are. I'm just saying that they might not be exactly as stated.
6:09:28
Protectionist policies have long existed to insulate companies from foreign competition. Huawei's technology is
6:09:35
certainly threatening because it's better in some ways than American technology. Look at Alibaba and Tencent
6:09:42
and compare them with American equivalents. Americans might ask why these companies are not competing in the
6:09:49
US. It is mostly for the same reasons that Amazon and a number of other American tech companies aren't freely
6:09:56
competing in China. In any case, there is a tech decoupling going on that is
6:10:02
part of the greater decoupling of China and the US which will have a huge impact on what the world will look like in 5
6:10:09
years. What would a worsening of the tech war look like? The United States has a technology
6:10:17
lead, though it's shrinking fast. As a result, the Chinese currently have great
6:10:22
dependencies on imported technologies from both US and non US sources that the
6:10:27
US can influence. This creates a great vulnerability for China, which in turn
6:10:33
creates a great weapon for the United States. It most obviously exists in
6:10:38
advanced semiconductors, though it exists in other technologies as well. The dynamic with the world's leading
6:10:45
chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which provides the Chinese and the world with needed
6:10:52
chips and which can be influenced by the United States, is one of many interesting dynamics to watch,
6:10:58
especially since it is located in Taiwan. There are many such Chinese technology imports that are essential to
6:11:05
China's well-being and many fewer American imports from China that are essential to the United States
6:11:11
well-being. If the United States shuts off Chinese access to essential technologies, that
6:11:18
would signal a major step up in the risk of a shooting war. On the other hand, if
6:11:23
events continue to transpire as they have been transpiring, China is poised to be much more independent and in a
6:11:30
much stronger position than the United States technologically in 5 to 10 years, at which time we will likely see these
6:11:37
technologies much more decoupled. This picture changes by the day and it is
6:11:43
important to stay on top of it. The geopolitical
6:11:50
war sovereignty, especially as it relates to the Chinese mainland, Taiwan,
6:11:55
Hong Kong, and the East and South China seas, is probably China's biggest issue.
6:12:01
Beyond these are several other areas of strategic economic importance such as those countries involved in China's belt
6:12:08
and road initiative. As you might imagine, the century of humiliation in the 19th century and the
6:12:15
invasions by foreign barbarians during it gave Mao and the Chinese leaders to
6:12:21
this day compelling motivations to have complete sovereignty within their borders, get back the parts of China
6:12:28
that were taken away from them, for example, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and never again be so weak that they can be pushed
6:12:34
around by foreign powers. China's desire for sovereignty and for maintaining its
6:12:40
distinct ways of doing things, that is its culture, are why the Chinese reject
6:12:45
American demands for them to change Chinese internal policies, for example, to be more democratic, to handle the
6:12:52
Tibetans and the Weaguers differently, to change its approach to Hong Kong and Taiwan,
6:12:58
etc. In private, some Chinese point out that they don't dictate how the United
6:13:04
States should treat people within its borders. They also believe that the United States and European countries are culturally
6:13:11
prone to proitizing, that is, to imposing on others their values,
6:13:16
Judeo-Christian beliefs, morals, and ways of operating, and that this inclination has developed through the
6:13:22
millennia since before the Crusades. To the Chinese, the sovereignty risk and the proitizing risk
6:13:29
make a dangerous combination that could threaten China's ability to be all it can be by following the approaches that
6:13:36
it believes are best. The Chinese believe that their having sovereignty and the ability to approach things the
6:13:42
way that they believe is best as determined by their hierarchical governance structure is
6:13:48
sacrianked. Regarding the sovereignty issue, they also point out that there are reasons for them to believe that the
6:13:55
United States would topple their government, the Chinese Communist Party, if it could, which is also
6:14:02
intolerable. It is widely recognized that regime change has been commonly employed by the United States for
6:14:09
managing its world order. These are the biggest existential threats that I believe the Chinese would
6:14:16
fight to the death to defend and the United States must be careful in dealing with China if it wants to prevent a hot
6:14:23
war. For issues not involving sovereignty, I believe the Chinese expect to look to influence them
6:14:29
nonviolently and avoid a hot war. Probably the most dangerous
6:14:35
sovereignty issue is Taiwan. Many Chinese people believe that the United
6:14:40
States will never follow through with its implied promise to allow Taiwan and China to unite unless the US is forced
6:14:48
to do so. They point out that when the US sells the Taiwanese F-16 fighter jets
6:14:54
and other weapons systems, it sure doesn't look like the United States is facilitating the peaceful reunification
6:15:00
of China. As a result, they believe that the only way to ensure that China is
6:15:05
safe and united is to have the power to oppose the US in the hope that the US
6:15:11
will sensibly acquies when faced with a greater Chinese power. My understanding is that China is
6:15:18
now stronger militarily in that region of the world. Also, the Chinese military
6:15:23
is likely to get stronger at a faster pace, though deterrence through mutually assured destruction is most likely the
6:15:31
case. So, as I mentioned earlier, I would worry a lot if we were to see an
6:15:36
emerging fight over sovereignty, especially if we were to see a fourth Taiwan straight
6:15:42
crisis. Would the US fight to defend Taiwan? Uncertain. The US not fighting
6:15:48
would be a great geopolitical win for China and a great humiliation for the US. It would signal a decline of the US
6:15:56
empire in the Pacific and beyond in much the same way as the British loss of the Suez Canal signaled the end of the
6:16:03
British Empire in the Middle East and beyond. The implications of that would
6:16:08
extend well beyond that loss. For example, in the British case, it signaled the end of the pound as a
6:16:15
reserve currency. The more of a show the US makes of defending Taiwan, the
6:16:20
greater the humiliation of a lost war or a retreat would be. That is concerning
6:16:26
because the United States has been making quite a show of defending Taiwan. While destiny appears to be bringing a
6:16:32
direct conflict to a head before long. If the US does fight, I believe that a
6:16:38
war with China over Taiwan that costs American lives would be very unpopular
6:16:44
in the US and the US would probably lose that fight. So the big question is
6:16:49
whether that would lead to a broader war that scares everyone. Hopefully the fear
6:16:55
of that great war and the destruction it would produce like the fear of mutually assured destruction will prevent
6:17:03
it. At the same time, from my discussions, it is my belief that China has a strong desire not to have a hot
6:17:10
war with the US or to forcibly control other countries as distinct from having
6:17:16
the desire to be all it can be and to influence countries within its region. I
6:17:22
know that the Chinese leadership understands how terrible a hot war would be and worries about unintentionally
6:17:28
slipping into one. Allah World War I. They would much prefer a cooperative
6:17:33
relationship if such a relationship is possible and I suspect they would happily divide the world into different
6:17:39
spheres of influence. Still, they have their red lines that is limits to what
6:17:45
can be compromised on that if crossed would lead to a hot war. And they expect more challenging times ahead.
6:17:53
For example, as PresidentQi said in his 2019 New Year's address, looking at the
6:17:59
world at large, we are facing a period of major change never seen in a century.
6:18:04
No matter what these changes bring, China will remain resolute and confident
6:18:09
in its defense of national sovereignty and security. This statement was made in connection
6:18:15
with the Taiwan reunification issue regarding influence around the
6:18:21
world. For both the United States and China, there are certain areas that each finds most important primarily on the
6:18:28
basis of proximity. They care most about countries and areas closest to them
6:18:34
andor of obtaining essentials. They care most about not being cut off from essential minerals and technologies and
6:18:41
to a lesser extent of their export markets. The areas that are most important to the Chinese are first those
6:18:48
that they consider to be part of China. Second, those on their borders in the China seas and those in key supply
6:18:55
lanes, belt and road countries or those that are suppliers of key imports. and
6:19:01
third other countries of economic or strategic importance for partnerships. Over the past few years,
6:19:08
China has significantly expanded its activities in these strategically important countries, especially belt and
6:19:15
road countries, resourcerich developing countries and some developed countries.
6:19:21
This is greatly affecting geopolitical relations. These activities are economic
6:19:26
and are occurring via increasing investments in targeted countries. for example, loans, purchases of assets,
6:19:33
building infrastructure facilities such as roads and stadiums, and providing military and other support to country's
6:19:40
leaders. While the US is receding from providing aid to these places, this
6:19:46
economic globalization has been so extensive that most countries have had to think hard about their policies
6:19:52
regarding allowing the Chinese to buy assets within their borders.
6:19:57
Generally speaking, the Chinese appear to want tributarylike relationships with most non-rival countries. Though the
6:20:05
closer their proximity to China, the greater the influence China wants over them. In reaction to these changing
6:20:12
circumstances, most countries in varying degrees are wrestling with the question of whether it is better to be aligned
6:20:18
with the United States or with China with those in closest proximity needing
6:20:24
to give the most consideration to this question. In discussions with leaders from different parts of the world, I
6:20:31
have repeatedly heard it said that there are two overriding considerations, economic and military. They almost all
6:20:38
say that if they were to choose on the basis of economics, they would choose China because China is more important to
6:20:45
them economically in trade and capital flows. While if they were to choose on the basis of military support, the
6:20:52
United States has the edge. But the big question is whether the United States will be there to protect them militarily
6:20:59
when they need it. Most doubt that the US will fight for them and some in the
6:21:04
Asia-Pacific region question whether the US has the power to win. The economic benefits that China is
6:21:12
providing these countries is significant and is working in a way that is broadly similar to the way the United States
6:21:19
provided economic benefits to key countries after World War II to help secure the desired relationships.
6:21:26
It was not many years ago that there were no significant rivals to the United States. So, it was quite easy for the
6:21:33
United States to simply express its wishes and find that most countries would comply. The only rival powers were
6:21:40
the Soviet Union, which in hindsight wasn't much of a rival, and its allies
6:21:45
and a few of the developing countries that were not economic rivals. Over the
6:21:50
last few years, Chinese influence over other countries has been expanding. While US influence has been receding,
6:21:58
that is also true in multilateral organizations, for example, the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, the
6:22:06
World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, and the International Court of Justice, most of
6:22:12
which were set up by the United States at the beginning of the American World Order. as the United States has been
6:22:19
pulling back from them. These organizations are weakening and China is playing a greater role in them. Over the
6:22:26
next 5 to 10 years, in addition to there being decoupling in other areas, we will
6:22:32
be seeing which countries align themselves with each of these leading powers. Beyond money and military power,
6:22:39
how China and the US interact with other countries, how they use their soft powers will influence how these
6:22:46
alliances will be made. Style and values will matter. For example, during the
6:22:52
Trump years, I heard leaders around the world describe both countries leaders as brutal. While you don't hear that as
6:22:59
much with President Biden, other countries broadly fear that they will be punished if they don't do exactly what
6:23:05
these two countries leaders want. And they don't like it to the point of being driven into the other's
6:23:11
arms. It will be important to see what these alliances will look like because throughout history, as we've seen, the
6:23:19
most powerful country is typically taken down by alliances of countries that are less powerful but collectively stronger.
6:23:27
Perhaps the most interesting relationship to watch is between China and Russia. Since the new world order
6:23:34
began in 1945, among China, Russia, and the United States, two out of the three
6:23:40
have become allied to attempt to neutralize or overpower the third. Russia and China each has a lot of what
6:23:47
the other needs. Natural resources and military equipment for China from Russia
6:23:52
and financing for Russia from China. Also, because Russia is militarily
6:23:58
strong, it would be a good military ally. We can start to see this happening
6:24:03
by watching where the countries line up on the issues. For example, whether to allow Huawei in with the United States
6:24:10
or China. In addition to the international political risks and opportunities, there
6:24:16
are of course big domestic political risks and opportunities in both countries. That is because there are
6:24:22
different factions who are fighting for control of both governments and there will inevitably be changes in leadership
6:24:29
that will produce changes in policies. While nearly impossible to anticipate, whoever is in charge will be
6:24:36
faced with the challenges that now exist and that are unfolding in the big cycle ways we have been discussing. Since all
6:24:44
leaders and all other participants in these evolutionary cycles, including all of us, step on and get off at different
6:24:51
parts of these cycles, they and we face a certain set of likely situations to be
6:24:57
encountered. Since other people in history have stepped on and off at the same parts of past cycles, by studying
6:25:04
what these others encountered and how they handled their encounters at the analogous stages and by using some
6:25:11
logic, we can imperfectly imagine the range of possibilities. The capital
6:25:19
war. As history has shown, one of the biggest risks in a conflict is that
6:25:24
access to one's money/c capital can be shut off. This can happen by a the moves
6:25:31
of one's opponents and or b self-inflicted harmful actions, for example, getting into too much debt and
6:25:38
devaluing one's money that lead those who provide capital to not want to provide it. In chapter 6, I reviewed
6:25:46
classic capital war moves. Some of these are now being used and could be used in
6:25:51
a more forceful way, so they have to be watched closely. The goal in a capital war is to
6:25:58
cut the enemy off from capital because no money equals no power. The degrees to
6:26:04
which these things occur correspond to the severity of the conflict. Sanctions,
6:26:09
as they are now called and employed, come in many forms with the broad categories being financial, economic,
6:26:17
diplomatic, and military. Within each of these categories, there are many versions and applications. I'm not going
6:26:24
to delve into the various versions and targets because that would be too much of a digression.
6:26:30
The main things to know are the United States greatest power comes from having
6:26:36
the world's leading reserve currency which gives the US enormous buying power because it gives it the ability a to
6:26:43
print the world's money and have it widely accepted abroad and b to control
6:26:48
who gets it. The United States is at risk of losing its reserve currency status.
6:26:56
The US dollar remains the dominant world reserve currency because it is used for
6:27:01
trade, global capital transactions and reserves much more than any other
6:27:07
currency. History and logic show that the leading reserve currency is slow to
6:27:12
be replaced for the same reasons that the leading world language is slow to be replaced because so many people have
6:27:18
adopted it and because it is entwined within the system. The existing positions of reserve currencies as
6:27:25
reflected by the amounts held by central banks are shown in the next PDF chart.
6:27:31
Share of central bank reserves by currency because the dollar is the dominant currency in world trade capital
6:27:38
flows and reserves which puts the US in the enviable position of being able to
6:27:43
print the world's money and to inflict sanctions on its enemies. The US now has
6:27:49
an arsenal of sanctions, which is its most used arsenal of weapons. As of
6:27:55
2019, there were approximately 8,000 US sanctions in place targeted at
6:28:00
individuals, companies, and governments. Through these powers, the US can get the
6:28:05
money it needs, and it can cut off opposing countries from getting money and credit by preventing financial
6:28:11
institutions and others from dealing with them. These sanctions are by no means perfect or all-encompassing, but
6:28:18
they are generally effective. The United States is at risk of losing its dominant
6:28:24
position as a reserve currency because the amounts of dollar
6:28:29
denominated debt in foreigners portfolios such as central bank reserves and sovereign wealth funds are
6:28:35
disproportionately large based on a number of measures of what the size of reserve currency holdings should be.
6:28:42
The shares of dollar denominated debt are large in relation to A the percentage of asset allocations that
6:28:49
international investors would hold to balance their portfolios well, B the
6:28:54
sizes of reserve currency holdings that are appropriate to meet trade and capital flow funding needs and C the
6:29:02
size and importance of the US economy relative to other economies. dollar denominated debt is now
6:29:09
disproportionately large because the dollar is the world's leading reserve currency which means it is perceived as
6:29:15
a safer asset than it really is and because dollar borrowings have been disproportionately large. Now, most of
6:29:23
those who are responsible for determining what the shares of their holdings should be in different markets
6:29:28
are not inclined to increase the shares in line with the greater amounts of US bonds to be sold and are in fact
6:29:35
considering reducing their shares held in US debt which if it happens will
6:29:40
require larger purchases by the Federal Reserve. The US government and the US central
6:29:47
bank are increasing the amounts of dollar denominated debt and money at an extraordinarily fast pace. So it will
6:29:54
likely be hard to find adequate demand for US debt without the Federal Reserve having to monetize a lot of it. While at
6:30:01
the same time the financial incentives to hold this debt are unattractive because the US government is paying a
6:30:08
negligible nominal yield and a negative real yield on it.
6:30:13
Holding debt as a medium of exchange or as a storehold of wealth during wartime is less desirable than during peace
6:30:20
time. So if there were movements toward war, the value of debt, which is a promise to receive fiat currency, and
6:30:27
fiat currency would likely go down relative to other things. This is not
6:30:33
currently an issue, but would become one if wars intensify. The roughly $1 trillion of US debt that
6:30:41
China holds is a risk, but not an unmanageable one, as that equals only
6:30:46
around 4% of the roughly $28 trillion outstanding as of May 2021.
6:30:53
However, because other countries realize that actions taken against China could be taken against them, any actions taken
6:31:01
against Chinese holdings of dollar assets would likely increase the perceived risks of holding dollar debt
6:31:07
assets by other holders of these assets, which would reduce the demand for such
6:31:12
assets. This is not currently an issue, though it appears to be close to becoming an issue.
6:31:19
The dollar's role as a reserve currency largely depends on its being freely exchanged between countries. So to the
6:31:26
extent that the US might in the future put controls on its flows andor run monetary policy in ways that are
6:31:33
contrary to the world's interests in pursuit of its own interests that would make the dollar less desirable as the
6:31:39
world's leading reserve currency. This is not currently an issue, but will become one if foreign exchange controls
6:31:46
are raised as a possibility, which is typical at the next stage of the
6:31:51
cycle. Countries being hurt by US sanctions are developing ways to get around them or undermining the United
6:31:58
States power to impose them. For example, Russia and China, which both are encountering these sanctions and are
6:32:05
at great risk of encountering more of them in the future, are each now developing and cooperating with the
6:32:11
other to develop an alternative payment system. China's central bank has created
6:32:16
a digital currency, which will make China less exposed to US sanctions.
6:32:22
There are no good currency alternatives because the dollar 51% of central bank
6:32:29
reserves has weakening fundamentals in the way described in chapter 11 which I
6:32:35
won't repeat here. The euro 20% is a weakly
6:32:40
structured fiat currency made by smaller uncoordinated countries with weak finances that are tenuously held
6:32:47
together by a highly fragmented currency union. Because the European Union is
6:32:52
financially, economically, and militarily at best a secondary power, buying its currency and debt denominated
6:33:00
in its currency, which its central bank is free to print, is not an enticing thing to
6:33:05
do. Gold 12% is a hard currency that is held because it has worked the best over
6:33:12
the ages and because it is an effective diversifier to other assets held, particularly fiat currencies. While
6:33:20
before 1971, gold was at the foundation of the world's currency system, at this
6:33:25
time it is a relatively dead asset since there are no significant international trade and capital transactions in it,
6:33:33
and it isn't used to balance external accounts. It is also a market that is
6:33:38
too small to become a high share of wealth at current prices. A move to gold
6:33:43
from fiat currencybased assets, that is credit assets, which would only come in
6:33:48
the event of an abandonment of that system, which history shows could come, would lead to an explosion in gold's
6:33:55
price. The yen, 6%, is a fiat currency that is
6:34:01
also not widely used internationally by non-Japanese people and suffers from a
6:34:06
lot of the same problems that the dollar has, including having too much debt that is increasing quickly and being
6:34:12
monetized so that it is paying unattractive interest rates. Also, Japan
6:34:17
is only a moderate global economic power and is a weak military power.
6:34:23
The pound 5% is an anacronistically held fiat currency that has relatively weak
6:34:30
fundamentals and the UK is relatively weak in almost all of our measures of a country's economic geopolitical
6:34:38
power. The renmanb 2% is the only fiat currency to be chosen as a reserve
6:34:44
currency because of its fundamentals. China's potential is sizable. Its shares
6:34:50
of world trade, world capital flows and world GDP are roughly equal to the
6:34:55
United States. This data is adjusted for purchasing power parody. China has managed its currency
6:35:02
to be relatively stable against other currencies and against goods and services prices. It has large foreign
6:35:09
exchange reserves. It doesn't have a 0% interest rate and a negative real interest rate. And it isn't printing and
6:35:16
monetizing a lot of debt. Increasing investments in China strengthens the
6:35:21
currency because those purchases have to be made in its currency. Those are the
6:35:27
positives. The negatives are that China has a relatively large amount of domestic debt that has to be
6:35:33
restructured. The renmanb is not a currency that is widely used for global trade and financial transactions.
6:35:40
China's clearing system is undeveloped and money is not allowed to freely flow
6:35:46
in and out of the currency. So there are no attractive world reserve
6:35:51
currencies to compete with the dollar. History has shown that whenever
6:35:56
a currencies are not desired and b there are no other currencies that are attractive to go into the currencies are
6:36:04
still devalued and the capital finds its way into other investments. For example, gold, commodities, stocks, property,
6:36:12
etc. As a result, there is no need to have a strong alternative currency for a
6:36:17
devaluation of a currency to take place. Things will change. To the extent
6:36:24
that the United States and China are in a capital war, the development of Chinese currency and capital markets
6:36:30
would be detrimental for the United States and beneficial for China. without
6:36:35
the US attacking China's currency and capital markets in an attempt to weaken them and/or the Chinese hurting their
6:36:42
own currency and capital markets by making policy shifts that make these markets less attractive. China's
6:36:49
currency and capital markets will probably develop quickly to increasingly compete with US markets. It is up to
6:36:56
American policymakers to decide whether or not they will try to disrupt this evolutionary path by becoming more
6:37:03
aggressive or accept that evolution, which will likely lead to China becoming
6:37:08
relatively stronger, more self-sufficient, and less vulnerable to being squeezed by the US.
6:37:15
Though the Chinese have less power to hurt the US dollar and its capital markets and its best moves would be to
6:37:21
strengthen its own currency, there are some possibilities that it will attempt to harm the dollar. As explained in my
6:37:29
study of past cycles, the war typically intensifies as the cycle progresses.
6:37:35
Comparing historical cases with their modern-day equivalents, for example, moves by the US and Japan prior to World
6:37:42
War II with moves by the US and China now should be helpful as the cycle
6:37:50
progresses. The military war. I am not a military expert, but I
6:37:57
get to speak with military experts and I do research on the subject. So, I will pass along what has been shared with me.
6:38:04
Take it or leave it as you wish. It is impossible to visualize what
6:38:09
the next major military war will be like, though it probably will be much worse than most people imagine. That is
6:38:16
because a lot of weaponry has been developed in secret and because the creativity and capabilities to inflict
6:38:22
pain have grown enormously in all forms of warfare since the last time the most powerful weapons were used and seen in
6:38:29
action. There are now more types of warfare than one can imagine and within
6:38:35
each more weapons systems than anyone knows. While of course nuclear warfare
6:38:40
is a scary prospect, I have heard equally scary prospects of biological,
6:38:45
cyber, chemical, space and other types of warfare. Many of these are untested. So
6:38:51
there is a lot of uncertainty about how they would go. Based on what we do know, the
6:38:57
headline is that the United States and China's geopolitical war in the East and South China seas is escalating
6:39:04
militarily because both sides are testing the other's limits. China is now
6:39:09
militarily stronger than the United States in the East and South China Seas. So, the US would probably lose a war in
6:39:16
that region, while the United States is stronger around the world and overall and would probably win a bigger war. But
6:39:24
a bigger war is too complicated to imagine well because of the large number of unknowns including how other
6:39:31
countries would behave in it and what technologies secretly exist. The only
6:39:36
thing that most informed people agree on is that such a war would be unimaginably
6:39:41
horrible. Also notable, China's rate of improvement in its military power, like
6:39:48
its other rates of improvement, has been extremely fast, especially over the last 10 years. And the future rate is
6:39:55
expected to be even faster, even more so if China's economic and technological improvements continue to outpace those
6:40:02
of the United States. Some people imagine that China could achieve broad military superiority in 5 to 10 years. I
6:40:10
don't know if that is true. As for potential locations of military
6:40:16
conflict, Taiwan, the East and South China Seas, and North Korea are the hottest spots, and India and Vietnam are
6:40:23
the next for reasons I won't digress into. As far as a big hot war between
6:40:29
the United States and China is concerned, it would include all the previously mentioned types of wars, plus
6:40:35
more pursued at their maximums. Because in a fight for survival, each would
6:40:40
throw all it has at the other. The way other countries throughout history have,
6:40:46
it would be World War II, and World War II would likely be much deadlier than World War II, which was much deadlier
6:40:53
than World War I because of the technological advances in the ways we can hurt each other.
6:40:59
Proxy wars are also part of the picture and should be watched as they are very effective in chipping away at a leading
6:41:05
world power's strength and global influence. In thinking about the timing
6:41:11
of a war, I keep in mind the principles that when countries have big internal
6:41:16
disorder, it is an opportune moment for opposing countries to aggressively exploit their vulnerabilities.
6:41:23
For example, the Japanese made their moves to invade China in the 1930s when China was divided and exhausted by its
6:41:30
ongoing civil war. History has taught us that when there are leadership transitions and/or
6:41:37
weak leadership at the same time that there is big internal conflict, the risk of the enemy making an offensive move
6:41:44
should be considered elevated. Because time is on China's side, if there is to
6:41:49
be a war, it is in the interest of the Chinese to have it later, for example, 5 to 10 years from now, when it will
6:41:56
likely be stronger and more self-sufficient, and in the interest of the US to have it
6:42:02
sooner. I'm now going to add two other types of war. The culture war, which
6:42:08
will drive how each side will approach these circumstances, including what they would rather die for than give up. and
6:42:14
the war with ourselves which will determine how effective we are and which will lead us to be strong or weak in the
6:42:21
critical ways we explored in chapter 1. The culture
6:42:27
war how people are with each other is of paramount importance in determining how
6:42:33
they will handle the circumstances that they jointly face and the cultures that they have will be the biggest
6:42:38
determinance of how they are with each other. What Americans and the Chinese
6:42:44
value most and how they think people should be with each other determine how they will deal with each other in
6:42:49
addressing the conflicts that we just explored. Because Americans and the Chinese have different values and
6:42:56
cultural norms that they will fight and die for. If we are going to get through our differences peacefully, it is
6:43:02
important that both sides understand what these are and how to deal with them well. As described earlier, Chinese
6:43:10
culture compels its leaders and society to make most decisions from the top down, demanding high standards of
6:43:17
civility, putting the collective interest ahead of individual interests, requiring each person to know their role
6:43:23
and how to play it well, and having filial respect for those superior in the
6:43:29
hierarchy. They also seek rule by the proletariat, which in common parliament
6:43:34
means that opportunities and rewards are broadly distributed. In contrast, American culture compels
6:43:41
its leaders to run the country from the bottom up, demanding high levels of personal freedom, favoring individualism
6:43:48
over collectivism, admiring revolutionary thinking and behavior, and not respecting people for their
6:43:54
positions as much as for the quality of their thinking. These core cultural
6:43:59
values drove the types of economic and political systems each country chose.
6:44:06
To be clear, most of these differences aren't obvious in day-to-day life. They generally aren't very important relative
6:44:12
to the shared beliefs that Americans and the Chinese have, which are numerous and they aren't held by all Chinese or all
6:44:19
Americans, which is why many Americans are comfortable living in China and vice
6:44:25
versa. Also, they are not pervasive. For example, the Chinese in other domains
6:44:30
such as Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have had governance systems that are similar to Western democratic systems.
6:44:38
Still, these cultural differences subtly affect most everything. And in times of
6:44:43
great conflict, they are the defining differences that determine whether the parties fight or peacefully resolve
6:44:49
their disputes. The main challenge the Chinese and Americans have with each other arises
6:44:56
from some of them failing to understand and empathize with the others values and ways of doing things and not allowing
6:45:02
each other to do what they think is best. While the opening up of both countries has increased their
6:45:09
interactions and their increasingly shared practices, for example, their similar economic freedoms that produce
6:45:15
similar desires, products, and outcomes have made both environments and their people much more similar than they ever
6:45:22
were before. The differences in approaches are still notable. They are
6:45:27
reflected in how each country's government and its people interact with each other and how Americans and the
6:45:32
Chinese interact, especially at the leader to policymaker level. Some of these cultural differences are minor and
6:45:39
some of them are so major that many people would fight to the death over them. For example, most Americans
6:45:46
believe in give me liberty or give me death. While to the Chinese, individual liberty isn't nearly as important as
6:45:52
collective stability is. These differences are also reflected in everyday life. For example, the
6:46:00
Chinese government being more paternal regulates what types of video games children play and how many hours a day
6:46:07
they can play them. Whereas in the United States, video games aren't government regulated because such things
6:46:13
are considered an individual parents decision to make. One could argue the merits of either approach.
6:46:21
The Chinese hierarchical culture makes it natural for the Chinese to simply accept the government's direction, while
6:46:27
the American non- hierarchical culture makes it acceptable for Americans to fight with their government over what to
6:46:34
do. Similarly, different cultural inclinations influenced how Americans
6:46:39
and the Chinese reacted to being told that they had to wear masks in response to CO 19, which led to second order
6:46:46
consequences because the Chinese followed the instructions and Americans often didn't, affecting the numbers of
6:46:52
cases and deaths and the economic impact. These culturally determined differences
6:46:58
in how things are handled affect how the Chinese and Americans react differently to many things. Information, privacy,
6:47:06
free speech, free media, etc., which add up to lots of ways that the countries
6:47:12
operate differently. While there are pros and cons to these different cultural approaches, and I'm
6:47:18
not going to explore them here, I do want to get across that the cultural differences that make Americans American
6:47:25
and the Chinese are deeply embedded. Given China's impressive track record
6:47:31
and how deeply imbued the culture behind it is, there is no more chance of the Chinese giving up their values and their
6:47:38
system than there is of Americans giving up theirs. Trying to force the Chinese
6:47:44
and their systems to be more American would to them mean subjugation of their most fundamental beliefs which they
6:47:50
would fight to the death to protect. To have peaceful coexistence, Americans must understand that the
6:47:57
Chinese believe that their values and their approaches to living out these values are best as much as Americans
6:48:04
believe their American values and their ways of living them out are best.
6:48:09
For example, one should accept the fact that when choosing leaders, most Chinese believe that having capable, wise
6:48:16
leaders make the choices preferable to having the general population make the choice on a one person, one vote basis
6:48:24
because they believe that the general population is less informed and less capable. Most believe that the general
6:48:30
population will choose the leaders on whims and based on what those seeking to be elected will give them in order to
6:48:37
buy their support rather than what's best for them. Also, they believe like
6:48:42
Plato believed and as has happened in a number of countries that democracies are
6:48:48
prone to slip into dysfunctional anarchies during very bad times when people fight over what should be done
6:48:54
rather than support a strong capable leader. They also believe that their system of
6:49:00
choosing leaders lends itself to better multigenerational strategic decision-making because any one leader's
6:49:07
term is only a small percentage of the time that is required to progress along its long-term developmental arc.
6:49:15
In fact, it is a challenge for the Chinese to deal with the lack of continuity of policies and directions in
6:49:20
the US arising from seemingly whimsical shifts in what matters to the American public as expressed in whom they choose
6:49:28
to represent them. They believe that what is best for the collective is most
6:49:33
important and best for the country and is best determined by those at the top. Their system of governance is more like
6:49:39
what is typical in big companies, especially multigenerational companies. So they wonder why it is hard for
6:49:46
Americans and other westerners to understand the rationale for the Chinese system following this approach and to
6:49:53
see the challenges of the democratic decision-making process as the Chinese see them. To be clear, I'm not seeking to
6:50:00
explore the relative merits of these decision-making systems. I'm simply trying to make clear that there are
6:50:06
arguments on both sides and to help Americans and the Chinese see things through each other's eyes and most
6:50:12
importantly to understand that the choices between accepting, tolerating, and even respecting each other's right
6:50:19
to do what each thinks is best or having the Chinese and Americans fight to the death over what they believe is
6:50:25
uncompromisable. The American and Chinese economic and political systems are different because
6:50:32
of the differences in their histories and the differences in their cultures that have resulted from these histories.
6:50:38
As far as economics is concerned, the two different viewpoints, the classic left favoring government ownership of
6:50:45
the means of production, the poor, the redistribution of wealth, etc., which the Chinese call communism and the
6:50:52
classic right favoring private ownership of the means of production whoever succeeds in the system and much more
6:50:59
limited redistributions of wealth exist in China as in the rest of the world and
6:51:05
there have been swings from one to the other in all societies especially in China. So it would not be correct to say
6:51:11
that the Chinese are culturally left or right. Similar swings in American
6:51:16
preferences have existed throughout its much more limited history. I suspect that if the United States had a longer
6:51:23
history, we would have seen wider swings as we have in Europe through its longer
6:51:29
history. For these reasons, these left versus right inclinations appear to be
6:51:34
more big cycle swings around revolutionary trends than evolving core values.
6:51:41
In fact, we are seeing these swings now taking place in both countries. So, it's not a big stretch to say that policies
6:51:47
of the right, such as capitalism, are close to being more favored in China than in the United States and vice
6:51:54
versa. In any case, when it comes to economic systems, there don't appear to be a lot of clear distinctions rooted in
6:52:02
deep cultural preferences. In contrast to economic systems, the inclination of the Chinese to be
6:52:08
top-down hierarchical versus bottomup non- hierarchical appears to be deeply
6:52:14
embedded in their culture and in their political systems. While Americans are strongly inclined to be bottomup non-
6:52:22
hierarchical as for which approach will work best and win out in the end, I will
6:52:27
leave that for others to debate, hopefully without bias. Though I will note that most knowledgeable observers
6:52:34
of history have concluded that neither of these systems is always good or
6:52:39
bad. What works best varies according to a the circumstances and b how people
6:52:45
using these systems are with each other. No system will sustainably work well. In
6:52:51
fact, all will break down if the individuals in it don't respect it more than what they individually want. And if
6:52:58
the system is not flexible enough to bend with the times without breaking. As we imagine how Americans
6:53:06
and the Chinese will handle their shared challenge to evolve in the best possible way on this shared planet, I try to
6:53:13
imagine where their strong cultural inclinations, most importantly where the irreconcilable differences that they
6:53:20
would rather die for than give up will lead them. For example, most Americans and most
6:53:26
Westerners would fight to the death for the ability to have and express their opinions, including their political
6:53:33
opinions. In contrast, the Chinese value the respect for authority more, which is
6:53:39
reflected in and demonstrated by the relative powers of individuals and the organizations they belong to, and the
6:53:46
responsibility to hold the collective organization responsible for the actions of individuals in the collective.
6:53:54
Such a culture clash took place in October 2019 when the then general
6:54:00
manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Murray, tweeted an image expressing support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy
6:54:07
protest movement. He quickly pulled down his tweet and explained that his views
6:54:12
weren't representative of his team's views or the NBA's views. my was then
6:54:18
attacked by the American side, that is the press, politicians, and the public, for not standing up for free speech. And
6:54:25
the Chinese side held the whole league responsible and punished it by dropping all NBA games from China's state
6:54:32
television, pulling NBA merchandise from online stores and reportedly demanding
6:54:37
that the league fire my clash arose because of how important
6:54:43
free speech is to Americans and because Americans believe that the organization should not be punished for the actions
6:54:50
of the individual. The Chinese on the other hand believed that the harmful attack needed to be punished and that
6:54:57
the group should be held accountable for the actions of the individuals in it. One can imagine much bigger cases in
6:55:04
which much bigger conflicts arise due to such differences in deep-seated beliefs
6:55:09
about how people should be with each other. When they are in a superior position,
6:55:14
the Chinese tend to want a the relative positions to be clear, that is the party
6:55:20
in a subordinate position knows that it is in a subordinate position, b the
6:55:25
subordinate party to obey, and c the subordinate party to know that if it
6:55:30
doesn't do so, it will be punished. That is the cultural inclination style of
6:55:36
Chinese leadership. They can also be wonderful friends who will provide support when needed.
6:55:42
For example, when the governor of Connecticut was desperate to get personal protective equipment in the first big wave of CO 19 illnesses and
6:55:50
deaths and couldn't get it from the United States government or other American sources, I turned to my Chinese
6:55:56
friends for help and they provided what was needed, which was a lot. As China
6:56:01
goes global, a number of count's leaders and their populations have been both
6:56:06
grateful for and put off by China's acts of generosity and strict
6:56:12
punishments. Some of these cultural differences can be negotiated to the party's mutual satisfaction, but some of
6:56:19
the most important ones will be very difficult to negotiate away.
6:56:24
I think the main thing to realize and accept is that the Chinese and Americans have different values and will make
6:56:30
different choices for themselves than the other would like. For example, Americans might not like how the Chinese
6:56:38
handle their human rights issues and the Chinese might not like how Americans handle their human rights issues. The
6:56:44
question is what should be done about that? Should Americans fight with the Chinese to impose what they think the
6:56:50
Chinese should do on them and vice versa? Or should they agree not to intervene into what each other does? In
6:56:58
my opinion, it is too difficult, inappropriate, and probably impossible to force others in other countries to do
6:57:05
what they strongly believe is not good for them. The United States ability to
6:57:10
impose things on the Chinese and China's ability to impose things on the United States will be a function of their
6:57:17
relative powers. While I just explored the US China war issues, conveying the little
6:57:24
that I know about them relative to what I need to know, I want to remind you that these wars are far more complex
6:57:30
than onetoone conflicts. They are like multi-dimensional chess games because many countries are
6:57:37
involved with many other countries in many dimensions. For example, when I think of USChina relations, I have to
6:57:44
think way beyond their bilateral relations to think about their multilateral relationships in all
6:57:50
important dimensions. for example with all notable Asian, European and Middle
6:57:55
Eastern governments and private sectors and with all of those countries important relationships with the other
6:58:02
countries etc. In other words, in order to think about the US China relationship, I have to
6:58:09
think about the Saudi Arabia US and the Saudi Arabia China relationship. And to
6:58:14
that I have to think about the Saudi Arabia Iran relationship, the Saudi Arabia Israel, the Saudi Arabia Egypt
6:58:21
and many other relationships in all of their important dimensions, plus the other analogous
6:58:27
relationships. Without the aid of a good computer and a whole lot of data, it is
6:58:33
impossible to follow, let alone understand what's going on. It is way beyond me. And frankly, when I speak
6:58:40
with world leaders, I find it shocking how little they really understand what the others in this multi-dimensional
6:58:45
chess game are really thinking. The risk of unnecessary
6:58:53
war. As I explained in chapter six, stupid wars often happen as a result of
6:58:58
a tit fortat escalation process in which responding to even small actions of an
6:59:04
adversary is more important than being perceived as weak, especially when those
6:59:09
on both sides don't really understand the motivations of those on the other side.
6:59:14
History shows us that this is especially a problem for declining empires which tend to fight more than is logical
6:59:21
because any retreat is seen as a defeat. Take the issue of Taiwan. Even
6:59:28
though the US fighting to defend Taiwan would seem to be illogical, not fighting a Chinese attack on Taiwan might be
6:59:35
perceived as being a big loss of stature and power over other countries that won't support the US if it doesn't fight
6:59:42
and win for its allies. Additionally, such defeats can make leaders look weak to their own people,
6:59:48
which can cost them the political support they need to remain in power. And of course, miscalculations due to
6:59:55
misunderstandings when conflicts are transpiring quickly are dangerous. All these dynamics create
7:00:02
strong pulls toward wars accelerating, even though such mutually destructive wars are so much worse than cooperating
7:00:09
and competing in more peaceful ways. There is also risk of untruthful
7:00:15
emotional rhetoric taking hold in both the US and China, creating an atmosphere
7:00:20
for escalation. For example, in a recent Pew survey, a record 73% of Americans had an
7:00:27
unfavorable opinion of China. 73% believed the United States should
7:00:32
promote human rights in China. And 50% believed the US should hold China
7:00:38
responsible for the role it played in CO 19. Though I don't have surveys of Chinese
7:00:44
public opinion of the United States, I am told by many people that it has
7:00:50
deteriorated. It wouldn't take much to have these people demand accelerations of the
7:00:56
conflicts. Ultimately, it would be wise for leaders and citizens of both countries to recognize that the US and
7:01:03
China are in a competition of systems and abilities. Each will inevitably follow the system
7:01:09
that they believe works best for them. Americans have a slight lead in power, but it is shrinking and they're
7:01:16
outnumbered. And history has shown that while numbers of people can matter a lot, other factors, for example, the 18
7:01:23
determinants listed in chapter 2 matter more. So even small population empires
7:01:29
become leading world powers if they manage themselves well. That all implies
7:01:34
that what's most important to being strong is how we act with
7:01:39
[Music] ourselves. The war with ourselves, the enemy is
7:01:46
us. Our greatest war is with ourselves because we have the most control over
7:01:52
how strong or weak we are. Because it is pretty clear what makes countries strong
7:01:57
and weak. And because these strengths and weaknesses are measurable, it is easy to see how each country is doing.
7:02:04
These factors were laid out in the first and second chapters and measured by 18
7:02:09
determinants. I will briefly review them here and in the next and final part I will show these determinants for most
7:02:16
countries and will explore the leading indicators of them so that we can make projections of what's to come.
7:02:23
Before we do that, let's review the specific items that help make a great
7:02:28
empire. They are leadership that is strong enough and capable enough to
7:02:34
provide the essential ingredients for success, which include strong education.
7:02:40
By strong education, I don't just mean teaching knowledge and skills. I also mean teaching strong character, civility
7:02:48
and a strong work ethic which are typically taught in the family as well as in school. These lead to improved
7:02:55
civility that is reflected in factors such as low corruption and high respect
7:03:00
for rules such as the rule of law. People being able to work well
7:03:05
together united behind a common view of how they should be together is also important. When people have knowledge,
7:03:13
skills, good character and the civility to behave and work well together and there is a good system for allocating
7:03:20
resources which is significantly improved by being open to the best global thinking. The country has the
7:03:27
most important ingredients in order to succeed. That leads to it gaining greater competitiveness in global
7:03:34
markets, which brings in revenues that are greater than expenses, which leads the country to have strong income
7:03:40
growth, which allows it to make increased investments to improve infrastructure, education, and research
7:03:46
and development, which lead it to have rapidly increasing productivity, more
7:03:52
valuable output per hour worked. Increasing productivity is what increases wealth and productive
7:03:58
capabilities. When the country achieves higher productivity levels, it can become productive inventors in new
7:04:05
technologies. These new technologies are valuable for both commerce and the military. As the country becomes more
7:04:12
competitive in these ways, naturally, it gains a rising and significant share of
7:04:18
world trade, which requires it to have a strong military to protect its trade routes and to influence those who are
7:04:25
important to them outside their borders. In becoming economically preeminent, the
7:04:30
country develops strong and widely used currency, equity, and credit markets.
7:04:36
Naturally, those dominant in trade and capital flows have their currency used much more as the preferred global medium
7:04:43
of exchange and the preferred storehold of wealth, which leads to their currency becoming a reserve currency and the
7:04:50
building of at least one of the world's leading financial centers for attracting and distributing capital and expanding
7:04:57
their trade globally. Whatever makes these measures go up is good, and whatever makes them
7:05:04
go down is bad. For this reason, it is wise for citizens of all countries to ask themselves how
7:05:11
well they collectively and their leaders are doing at making the lines in these measures go up. I also hope that they
7:05:19
will remember the cause effect relationships, avoiding the excesses and divisions that lead to
7:05:25
declines. As for the case at hand, the internal wars and challenges in both China and the US are more important and
7:05:32
bigger than external wars and challenges. These include political wars within the leadership of the country and
7:05:39
at all levels of government. Wars between different factions, for example, the rich and the poor, the rural and the
7:05:46
urban, conservatives and progressives, ethnic groups, etc. Demographic changes,
7:05:52
climate change, etc. Fortunately, the most important of these forces are
7:05:57
within our control and are measurable, which allows us to see how we are doing and if we're not doing well, to make
7:06:04
changes. So these things move in the right directions. By and large, we will get
7:06:09
what we deserve. As Churchill said to the British people, deserve
7:06:16
victory. Part three. The future. Chapter 14. The future.
Chapter 14: The Future
7:06:26
He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass is a market
7:06:32
adage I learned when I was about 14. Since I've personally experienced it to
7:06:38
be true, it has affected how I look at both the future and the past. I have
7:06:43
learned to look at the past one to determine what's likely to happen and two to protect myself and others I am
7:06:50
responsible for against the possibility I am wrong or missing something important. While you and I and others
7:06:57
can argue about the patterns and cause effect relationships described in this book, if you listen to this for
7:07:04
practical purposes rather than just casual interest, then you like me need
7:07:09
to do those two things. Well, the purpose of this chapter is to share my thoughts about how I approach
7:07:16
the future. While what I don't know about the future is probably much more than what I do know, what I do know is
7:07:23
also a lot. Dealing with the future is all about one perceiving and adapting to
7:07:29
what is happening even if it can't be anticipated, two coming up with
7:07:34
probabilities for what might happen. And three knowing enough about what might happen to protect oneself against the
7:07:41
unacceptable even if one can't do that perfectly. Knowing how things have
7:07:47
changed in the past leads me to consider the possibility that something similar might happen in the future. That is a
7:07:54
big advantage relative to being unaware. For example, there are numerous examples in history of revolutions,
7:08:01
wars, and acts of nature leading to violent events in which virtually all wealth is wiped out or
7:08:08
confiscated. Knowing this, I am constantly looking for leading indicators of the same things happening
7:08:14
again. And having leading indicators of these, even if they aren't perfect, puts me in a better position to protect
7:08:20
myself than remaining blissfully unaware and unprepared for what might happen. While that example is of a worst
7:08:28
case scenario, being unaware of best case scenarios can be equally bad. I
7:08:34
remember very well how my dad and his friends failed to take advantage of the boom that followed the Great Depression
7:08:40
and World War II as their mindsets had been formed by those awful eras. In
7:08:46
playing the game of life, it pays to do one's best to understand how the world works, imagine the full range of
7:08:53
possibilities, including their risks and rewards, and know how to spread one's
7:08:58
bets around. Well, while I will pass along my thinking, please remember that
7:09:04
everything I say is debatable. The purpose of this whole project is to improve my assessed probabilities of
7:09:11
being right. As such, it is a work in progress, and I hope you will join me in evolving it. To that end, I plan to
7:09:19
continually update my understandings of these patterns and lessons at
7:09:24
economicprinciples.org, where we can interact to refine the picture.
7:09:30
My approach to quickly review my approach is based on my ideas about a evolution
7:09:37
which causes changes over time generally toward improvement such as increasing
7:09:43
productivity b cycles which cause rhythmic ups and downs in the economy
7:09:48
like debt bubbles and busts and bumps along the way non-riythmic ups and downs
7:09:53
like acts of nature and c indicators that can help us see where we are in the
7:09:58
cycles and what might come next. I will briefly recap my thoughts on
7:10:05
each evolution. The most important things evolve in ways that are easy to see and
7:10:13
extrapolate forward. So, it's not difficult to get a pretty good sense of roughly where they are likely to be in
7:10:19
the future, so long as a once in 500 years type game changer doesn't come along. The next PDF charts tell the
7:10:27
story about population, life expectancy, and prosperity. Let's start with world
7:10:34
population. The chart on the left starts at 1500 and the one on the right starts
7:10:40
at 1900. I show them both because I want you to see how different one's perspective would be if one were looking
7:10:47
back 100 years from 1900 versus 100 years from today. Note how dramatically
7:10:54
the population grew in the 20th century. Also note that the major historical
7:10:59
events mentioned in this audio book, including the Great Depression, the two world wars, and any number of natural
7:11:05
catastrophes, had no visible effect on the larger evolutionary
7:11:11
trend. The next two PDF charts show the population growth rate.
7:11:16
Notice the big ups and downs that don't show up in the prior charts because they are so minor in comparison to the
7:11:23
long-term trend. If we had personally experienced any of this volatility, it
7:11:28
would have felt like a life or death experience, which it very much was. The next two PDF charts show a
7:11:36
similar picture for life expectancy. There are a lot more wiggles in these charts than in the previous ones because
7:11:43
average life expectancy changes more when there are big events like wars and pandemics. I will show you what those
7:11:50
big killers were and where they occurred at economicprinciples.org.
7:11:55
Note how life expectancy stayed roughly the same about 25 to 30 years for about
7:12:02
350 years and then accelerated starting around 1900 when there were big
7:12:07
improvements in infant mortality rates and several medical advances like antibiotics. Importantly, a number of
7:12:14
the charts rely on the record from fewer countries further in the past due to limited reliable data history. Life
7:12:22
expectancy prior to the 1800s is solely based on Great Britain marked by the dotted line. Global RGDP is primarily a
7:12:31
mix of European countries before 1870 and there are not good records of total
7:12:36
wealth prior to the 1900s. So I can't show you the picture before
7:12:41
then. Now let's look at economic prosperity as measured by real that is
7:12:47
inflationadjusted GDP. The first PDF chart shows a similarly
7:12:53
sweeping picture. The real value of what was produced per person grew slowly until the 19th century and then
7:12:59
accelerated with that broad evolutionary trend dominant relative to the wobbles
7:13:05
within it. The next PDF chart shows real wealth per capita since 1900. From 1900 until
7:13:13
1945, there was no increase to speak of as that was the late cycle transition
7:13:18
phase from the 19th century boom to the new world order in 1945. Peace and prosperity followed the
7:13:26
creation of the new world order, and the uptrend was strong and pretty steady, averaging 4% per year, even though the
7:13:33
movements around it felt big when we went through them. With these evolutions in mind, let's
7:13:40
start looking toward the future. If we look back carefully to see how the present was created, we can see
7:13:47
that these evolutionary advances didn't just happen on their own. Every day, there were events that affected the
7:13:53
present while people's actions shaped them. At the same time, we know that we never could have anticipated them
7:14:00
individually. If we had tried to predict each of the specific wars, droughts, pandemics, inventions, prosperous
7:14:07
periods, declines, etc., we would have failed. But even without knowing about
7:14:13
any of those specific developments, we could have pretty confidently said that advances would occur that would enable
7:14:19
significantly larger populations to live significantly longer while enjoying significantly higher standards of living
7:14:27
because of the evolution that has already occurred. and that we have every reason to expect to continue to occur
7:14:33
from humanity's inventiveness. We could have also confidently asserted that there would be
7:14:39
booms and busts, feasts and famines, and periods of great health and disease along the
7:14:45
way. Based just on what happened in the past 100 years, one might conclude that
7:14:50
one can get pretty good estimates just by extrapolating the past forward. As an
7:14:56
example, by simply extrapolating the past 100 years, it would be reasonable to expect that in the next 10 years, the
7:15:03
world's population will be around 10 to 15% higher than it is today. The output
7:15:08
per person will be about 20% higher. The wealth per person will be 30% higher and
7:15:14
the average life expectancy will be 7.5% higher, give or take a bit. It would be
7:15:20
reasonable to expect that in the next 20 years they will be up 25 to 30%, 45%,
7:15:27
70% and around 15% respectively without knowing specifically how that will
7:15:33
happen. That simple, not especially thoughtful analysis paints a picture
7:15:38
that probably won't be far off, but it could be. It is easy to paint this
7:15:44
picture in much greater detail by looking at the same stats for each country and each subgroup within a
7:15:50
country in this way. Processing all of this information is pretty complicated
7:15:55
for the human mind alone, but not for a good human mind working with a
7:16:01
computer. But we can see that a picture drawn from pure extrapolation is not good enough. For example, standing in
7:16:09
1750, it would have been reasonable to believe that it was a timeless and universal truth that monarchies and
7:16:15
landowning nobles overseeing peasants with the help of soldiers would be the governance system in the future. That
7:16:22
agricultural land would continue to be the most important money-ning asset. That per capita incomes would grow at
7:16:29
only around half a percent per year, and that life expectancy would remain steady at about 30 years.
7:16:36
That was how it had always been. You would not have imagined capitalism and democracy as we now know it, let alone
7:16:43
that there would be a United States and that it would be the leading world power. The big curveballs come when a
7:16:51
few really big things cause a paradigm shift that alters the evolutionary rates of change. The paradigm shift that came
7:16:58
in the early 19th century arose from the confluence of the invention of modern tools of finance, machines that could do
7:17:05
the work of people, the development of more inclusive societies that broadened opportunities to be inventive and
7:17:12
productive, the increased use of books and libraries so knowledge could be more broadly shared, and the application of
7:17:19
the scientific method. While these things couldn't be anticipated, they could have been perceived, understood,
7:17:26
and adapted to. That's why while extrapolating the past is generally a
7:17:32
reasonable thing to do, also be prepared to be surprised because the future will
7:17:37
be much different than you expect it to be. Throughout my roughly 50 years of
7:17:43
investing, I have seen a number of wellestablished beliefs based on both what happened before and what seemed
7:17:49
logical at the time be proven wrong. To choose a recent example, the belief that
7:17:54
bond yields can't go negative. The greatest recent disruptor of wellestablished beliefs was the digital
7:18:02
revolution. Through these experiences and observations, I learned that
7:18:07
identifying, understanding, and adapting to paradigm shifts is essential, even if one can't anticipate them. Though trying
7:18:14
to anticipate them with good indicators that help, is important, too. Having
7:18:20
good indicators can also help you tell when what looks like a paradigm shift is only a passing fad, which is just as
7:18:27
important. Cycles and bumps along the
7:18:33
way. Cycles and bumps were covered comprehensively in prior chapters, but
7:18:38
they warrant reflection now that we are shifting our attention from the past to the
7:18:44
future. Though they barely register when compared to the mega macro picture, they
7:18:49
can damage and kill large numbers of people. Just look at the next PDF charts
7:18:54
that show depressions, declines in wealth, deaths in wars, and deaths via pandemics over the past 500 years to
7:19:02
gain some perspective about them. Those bad times were even worse than they look
7:19:07
because the charts capture them in terms of averages. As such, they understate
7:19:12
the severity of the experience for the people who were most directly affected. Most people don't think about
7:19:19
this darker picture. They look at the positive post 1945 trends and
7:19:24
extrapolate them forward. It's up to you to decide if you're in that camp, too.
7:19:29
As for me, seeing that these big deadly things have happened in the past leads me to distrust the belief that they
7:19:36
won't happen again. Unless and until someone shows me better evidence that
7:19:41
they won't happen again than the simple fact that they haven't happened yet, I am going to assume they will and try to
7:19:48
protect myself from their consequences. One of the overarching principles I
7:19:54
derived from my research and my 50 plus years of investing experience is in the
7:20:00
markets and in life to be successful one should bet on the upside that comes from
7:20:05
a evolution that leads to productivity improvements but not so aggressively that b cycles and bumps along the way
7:20:13
knock you out of the game. In other words, betting on things being better,
7:20:18
for example, real earnings being greater is pretty much a sure bet. But betting
7:20:24
too much on that so that a bump along the way can ruin you is bad. That's why
7:20:29
having quality indicators helps a lot. Quality
7:20:37
indicators because everything that happens is the result of events that have happened before. I have some pretty
7:20:43
good and logical though imperfect leading and coincident indicators of important changes. Some can be
7:20:50
quantified while others can't be. As previously explained, I found 18
7:20:55
determinants that explain most of the conditions and changes in wealth and power both within and between nations. I
7:21:02
will soon show you the readout of all of these 18 determinants for each of the 11 major powers I'm following in this book.
7:21:10
More detail on the top 20 countries is shown at economicprinciples.org. But first, I
7:21:16
want to share some big picture thoughts about the five determinants that have had the biggest impacts in the past and
7:21:22
that I believe will have the biggest impacts on what happens in the years ahead. Innovation, the
7:21:28
debt/money/c capital market cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle, the
7:21:34
external order and disorder cycle, and acts of nature. When looking at the
7:21:40
charts, remember that in some cases, the determinants rise and fall together because they are mutually reinforcing,
7:21:46
while in others, one country's gains are at the expense of anothers. For example,
7:21:52
inventing new technologies raises all of humanity's living standards, but it puts
7:21:57
the countries that are better at inventing in a superior position. Rising levels of military strength are clearly
7:22:03
less beneficial for humanity as they benefit some countries at the expense of
7:22:10
others. Humanity's inventiveness. As previously discussed,
7:22:16
innovation and inventiveness are clearly the most powerful determinant of a country's conditions.
7:22:23
Think about all the things that we can't imagine not having that were invented or discovered in just the last 150 years.
7:22:31
Before we had them, nobody could have imagined them. For example, the telephone, 1876. The electric light
7:22:38
bulb, 1879. The internal combustion powered vehicle, 1885. The radio,
7:22:45
1895. Movies, 1895. The airplane, 1903.
7:22:51
Television, 1926. Antibiotics, 1928. The computer,
7:22:58
1939. Nuclear weapons, 1945. Nuclear power plants,
7:23:04
1951. GPS, 1973. Digital cameras,
7:23:09
1975. Online shopping, 1979. The internet,
7:23:15
1983. Online search, 1990. Online banking
7:23:21
1995, Social Media 1997, Wi-Fi
7:23:26
1998, The iPhone 2007, crisper gene editing 2012, etc.,
7:23:34
etc., etc. Progress unfolds in big and steady
7:23:39
ways to shape the future, but does so through specific breakthroughs that we can't imagine. That is what evolution in
7:23:46
technologies and techniques look like. Evolution in most everything else, approaches to life, domestic and
7:23:53
international politics, etc. happens in a similar way. I believe that humanity's evolution
7:24:00
through its inventiveness is accelerating and that most people will benefit from it. That is because the
7:24:07
most significant inventions we are now seeing and that we know we will see many more of improve the quality and quantity
7:24:14
of all thinking. These inventions are coming in the forms of advances in computers, AI and other thinking related
7:24:22
technologies. Because they can be applied to many domains of human activity and decision-making, it seems
7:24:28
obvious to me that the rate of invention and improvement in most areas will accelerate at an even faster pace.
7:24:35
rapidly raising productivity and living standards. Humans now have computers to
7:24:41
help them think in ways in which they are comparatively handicapped. For example, computers have far more memory
7:24:48
than the human brain and it is readily accessible. They can process more data at a fantastically faster rate and they
7:24:55
do not make emotional mistakes. At the same time, humans can help computers get
7:25:01
past their inherent limitations. for example, their complete absence of imagination, intuition, common sense,
7:25:08
value judgments, and emotional intelligence. This collaboration between humans and computers will increase both
7:25:16
the quantity and quality of thinking, pretending radical improvements in almost every area of life. Soon, not
7:25:24
being able to read and write computer code will be like not being able to read and write words.
7:25:30
I know this because I have experienced it and I can already see some of these improvements on the
7:25:37
horizon. In other words, the abilities of both computers and humans will improve at an increasing pace. Perhaps
7:25:44
most importantly, advances in and the wider use of quantum computing with AI
7:25:50
will lead to unimaginable advances in rates of learning and improvement and changes in global wealth and power.
7:25:57
These changes will occur in varying degrees in the next 5 to 20 years, but I believe they will add up to the greatest
7:26:04
shift in wealth and power that the world has ever seen. Quantum computing with AI
7:26:10
will be to traditional computing what the computer was to the abacus, providing humanity with vastly more
7:26:17
power to see, understand, and shape things. That makes me long-term very optimistic
7:26:24
and eager to bet on great new discoveries. Even without the boosts
7:26:29
from quantum computing, I'd expect the human lifespan to increase by a lot over the next two decades by 20 to 25% or
7:26:38
more for reasons we can see and for many more reasons that we can't yet see. A
7:26:44
few inventions that are already on the horizon are AI and robotics in health care, health monitoring, and advice
7:26:50
providing wearables, advances in and the practical use of genome sequencing and
7:26:56
gene editing, mRNA improvements in vaccines, and breakthroughs in nutrition
7:27:02
and drugs. And if the past is any guide, and it is, there will be many more
7:27:08
inventions that we can't yet fathom. Naturally, I can't help but imagine the
7:27:13
implications for investing. All else being equal, equities in the companies
7:27:18
making new inventions and the companies that benefit from them are the right ones to own. If you want to bet on
7:27:24
evolution happening, but whether the returns to investors match the performance of the innovations depends
7:27:31
on how governments decide to divide the profits of productivity. If the world is
7:27:36
financially overextended and has large wealth gaps, this creates headwinds.
7:27:41
Also, price matters. It's possible to invest in great companies and lose money
7:27:47
because they are so expensive and invest in bad companies and make money because they are so cheap. Finally, and as with
7:27:55
everything else, there are downsides. Humanity's inventiveness and
7:28:00
the new technologies it produces can have bad as well as good effects.
7:28:06
Advances in technologies for inflicting harm will certainly occur alongside advances in medical care. So my view is
7:28:14
that inventiveness and increases in living standards will probably get a lot better a lot faster if humanity doesn't
7:28:21
kill itself first. The next PDF chart shows our latest
7:28:26
reading on the inventiveness, technological advancement, and entrepreneurship we see in major
7:28:32
countries. In the chart, arrows denote the 20-year change in the gauge. The
7:28:37
arrows on the top of the bars show whether the trend in each country standing has been up, sideways, or down.
7:28:45
This gauge gives about half its weight to one a combination of external rankings and measures of innovation per
7:28:52
capita to help capture how widespread innovation is in the economy and have to
7:28:58
two the country's absolute share of key innovation metrics for example researchers R&D spending patents Nobel
7:29:06
prizes and venture capital funding like all my gauges it is approximately right
7:29:12
but not perfectly right so It's meant to be broadly indicative. As shown, the US is at the
7:29:19
top of these measures with a marginal lead over China, which ranks second primarily due to the US's share of
7:29:26
global research spending, researchers, and its lead in other areas such as venture capital funding. But the US's
7:29:34
position is steady, while China's position in the standings is rising fast. Remember that whoever wins the
7:29:40
technology war usually wins the economic and military wars. For more detail on
7:29:46
all the gauges shown in this chapter, please refer to the end of this chapter where you can hear a short description
7:29:53
of each. The debt/money/c capital
7:30:00
market/economic cycle. As I explained earlier, this
7:30:05
cycle is the biggest driver of the ups and downs in economies that have big implications for internal and external
7:30:11
politics and wars. So, knowing where countries are in this cycle is essential to anticipating what's likely to come
7:30:18
next. Based on my readings of history, my readings of existing conditions, and
7:30:24
my understanding of how the economic machine works, the promises that are denominated in the world's reserve
7:30:30
currencies, most importantly, the dollar, are too large and growing too fast to be paid in hard money. In other
7:30:37
words, the debt that is denominated in these currencies is an overhang. So money will probably be printed to
7:30:44
service debts and debt growth and interest rates will probably be held below inflation and
7:30:50
economic/inccome growth rates. As a result, debt assets, especially cash,
7:30:55
will probably perform poorly and debt liabilities will probably be good to have, especially if invested in
7:31:02
profitable disruptive technologies and solid investments that have higher returns than the cost of funding them.
7:31:09
This reflects the fact that the major reserve currency countries are late in their debt, money, capital market,
7:31:16
economic cycles and that wealth will probably be increasingly redistributed from those who have a lot of it to those
7:31:23
who don't have enough of it in one way or another. The extent to which these things will be true will vary from
7:31:29
country to country, though it will likely be worldwide. For that reason, the biggest risk in the
7:31:36
long run is the currency value of money risk, which most people don't pay enough attention to. I hope chapter 4 helps
7:31:43
people understand and deal with it better. To be clear, because the reserve
7:31:49
currency countries that are running big deficits have their deficits and debts denominated in their own currencies,
7:31:55
their ability to print the money to service the debts transfers the risks from them as debtors to those who are
7:32:02
holding the debt as creditors. So the big risk is not that those big debtors will default. It is that creditors will
7:32:09
hold assets that will be devalued. That is that the returns from holding debt assets will be less than the inflation
7:32:16
rate. I believe a great transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors as happened in
7:32:21
the biblical years of Jubilee as explained in chapter 3 is coming for the same reasons that has always come in the
7:32:29
past. What does that mean for the dollar most importantly and the other more minor reserve currencies? Will they
7:32:36
decline and others replace them? Most probably they will decline analogously to past reserve currency declines slowly
7:32:44
for a long time and then very quickly. As we saw in those cases, the pace of
7:32:49
reserve currency declines significantly lags the pace of the declines in other measures of strength. Reserve currencies
7:32:57
tend to live on long after their fundamentals cease to justify their prominence because they become deeply
7:33:03
entrenched in the ways things are done and there is a strong inclination to keep them. Then they abruptly plunge
7:33:10
when it becomes clear that the fundamentals behind the currency make holding debt in it a bad
7:33:16
deal. The fall happens fast because the currency's rate of decline outpaces the
7:33:21
interest rate paid to the holders of the debt. The net losses lead to selling which causes more losses. So the spiral
7:33:28
becomes self-reinforcing. The Dutch Gilder and the British pound both plunged in this
7:33:34
way due to geopolitical crises and defeats happening when they had large debts. Those events made it clear to
7:33:42
creditors that their fundamentals were weaker than they had assumed and the interest rate couldn't compensate for
7:33:48
the decline. While I have very good indicators to identify this kind of decline happening
7:33:54
as it happens and some pretty good leading indicators that indicate when it will happen in the short term. My
7:34:01
long-term leading indicators are only so so for timing purposes. That is because
7:34:06
they are financial and based on supply and demand. It is pretty easy to assess
7:34:11
the financial conditions of countries in the same ways that one assesses the financial conditions of people and
7:34:17
companies by checking whether they are running surpluses or deficits and have more assets than liabilities and finding
7:34:24
out if their debts are in their own or foreign currencies and who is funding them and why. Because these are all
7:34:31
long-term drivers, it is also pretty easy to see which countries and currencies are vulnerable. But
7:34:37
anticipating exactly when the big fall will happen is difficult. The debt burden gauge shown
7:34:45
next is based on a combination of A debt levels relative to asset levels. B the
7:34:51
sizes of external and internal surpluses and deficits. C the sizes of debt
7:34:57
service costs relative to GDP. D the amount of debt in a country's own
7:35:02
currency versus foreign currency. E, the amount of debt held by its own citizens
7:35:08
versus foreigners, and F, its credit rating. I composed it this way because
7:35:14
this way has proven to be the most reliable way we have of foreshadowing declines in the real value of money and
7:35:21
the debt assets that are promises to receive money. Whether they come in the form of debt defaults that result from
7:35:27
not creating enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs or devaluations that come from creating
7:35:34
more than enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs. I constructed this index to exclude
7:35:40
reserve currency status so that I can see the exposure a country would have if it lost its reserve currency status.
7:35:48
Reserve currency status is shown in the next PDF chart. Together, these charts paint a
7:35:55
pretty clear picture. For example, while the US's debt burdens are high, its debt is denominated in dollars, the world's
7:36:02
leading reserve currency. So, it has the ability to print money to service its debts. This reduces its risk of default,
7:36:10
but increases its devaluation risk. As you can see, if the US lost its reserve
7:36:15
currency status, it would be in serious financial trouble. Russia and Germany
7:36:21
rank strongest on the debt burden gauge because they are the least indebted. Russia has no reserve currency status
7:36:28
and Germany has a fair amount because it uses the euro now the second most important reserve currency. China is in
7:36:36
the middle of the rankings on the debt burden gauge because its debts are moderately high mostly in its own
7:36:42
currency and mostly held by the Chinese. its reserve currency status is
7:36:48
emerging. Individual European countries are not shown on the reserve currency status gauge due to the European
7:36:55
Monetary Union. All these countries use the euro. So only the Europe aggregate
7:37:01
is shown. The measure shows an average of what share of global transactions, debts, and official central bank reserve
7:37:08
holdings are denominated in each country's currency.
7:37:14
The internal order and disorder cycle. Lu Guuan Jang's classic book
7:37:20
Romance of the Three Kingdoms begins. The empire long divided must unite and
7:37:26
long united must divide. Thus it has ever been. That has been true of China and
7:37:33
most other places and it is likely to continue. So it's a good principle. I
7:37:38
explained the big cycle of internal order and disorder in chapter 5. So I
7:37:43
won't reiterate it here other than to remind you of a key principle. Peace is
7:37:49
profitable and war is costly that holds both within countries
7:37:54
and between them. When parties cooperate and compete well and don't waste
7:37:59
resources on fighting, productivity and living standards rise. When they fight,
7:38:05
they waste resources, sometimes including lives. They destroy more than they produce, and living standards fall.
7:38:12
It is for this reason that the degree of conflict within a country is such an important
7:38:18
indicator. As of this writing, there are varying amounts of conflict going on within different countries. As shown in
7:38:24
the next PDF chart, internal conflict is especially high in the United States,
7:38:30
which appears to be in stage five of the cycle when there are bad financial conditions and intense conflict, while
7:38:37
China appears to be in stage three when there is peace and prosperity. Changes to this measure can
7:38:44
happen quickly. For example, the changes that produced the Arab Spring, the conflicts in Hong Kong, internal wars in
7:38:51
Syria and Afghanistan, recent big protests in Peru and Chile, etc.,
7:38:57
leading to revolutionary changes in their internal orders. Because I expect
7:39:02
that these readings will be out of date by the time you listen to this audio book, I will update them regularly at
7:39:09
economicprinciples.org. At the end of the day, power rules and
7:39:15
tests of power are the ways one learns who rules. Sometimes that happens within
7:39:20
a framework of rules that are respected. In those cases, fights for power occur
7:39:25
in a mutually agreed upon and productive way that supports the internal order.
7:39:31
But they can also happen in unproductive, no holdsbarred ways that can lead to the violent disruption of
7:39:37
both the leadership and the internal order. While I think that the odds of the US devolving into a stage 6 civil
7:39:44
war type dynamic within the next 10 years are only around 30%. That is a
7:39:50
dangerously high risk that must be protected against and watched closely via my coincident and leading
7:39:57
indicators. All internal orders, even those that are not democratic, have rules about how decisions are made and
7:40:04
how power is gained and shared. Because one can usually see how well these governance rules are respected or
7:40:11
ignored, it is pretty easy to see when an internal order is being threatened by an emerging civil war. For example, when
7:40:19
close elections are adjudicated and the losers respect the decisions, it is clear that the order is respected. When
7:40:26
power is fought over and grabbed, that clearly signals the significant risk of a revolutionary change with all its
7:40:32
attendant disorder. There have been signs of that happening in the US with some people contesting
7:40:39
the validity of elections and expressing a willingness to fight for their aims. This bears
7:40:45
watching. There is also an exceptional amount of polarization in the US right now as reflected in the stats. Survey
7:40:53
data about the sentiments of the voters paints a picture of polarization and intrigence. For example, in a 2019 Pew
7:41:01
survey, 55% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats viewed the other as more
7:41:08
immoral than other Americans, and 61% of Republicans and 54% of Democrats said
7:41:15
that those in the other party don't share their values. When asked whether they had warm or cold feelings to those
7:41:22
of the other party, 79% of Democrats and 83% of Republicans said they had cold or
7:41:29
very cold feelings for members of the other party. Of that, 57% of Democrats
7:41:34
and 60% of Republicans selected very cold. Another study reported that 80% of
7:41:41
Democrats think that the Republican party has been taken over by racists and 82% of Republicans think that the
7:41:48
Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists. A 2010 study showed that
7:41:54
nearly half of Republican parents and a third of Democratic parents would be displeased if their child married
7:42:01
someone from the other political party. That compares with about 5% for both
7:42:06
parties in 1960. One recent survey showed that 15% of
7:42:11
Republicans and 20% of Democrats thought the country would be better off if large numbers of the other side just
7:42:19
died. Very important and very telling political conflicts and changes lie ahead in the next few years. They will
7:42:26
be indicative of what the next stage in the increasingly disorderly internal orders will be like in the major
7:42:33
countries, especially in the US. While the United States looks like it is in the precarious stage five of the cycle,
7:42:40
it also has the longest lasting and most widely admired internal order, its
7:42:45
constitutional system. As explained in chapter 5, this makes it less likely
7:42:50
that it will be abandoned, but more traumatic if it is. The most reliable
7:42:56
signs of an escalation to civil war are one the rules being disregarded, two,
7:43:02
both sides emotionally attacking each other, and three, blood being spilled.
7:43:08
While stage six is the most dysfunctional and harmful stage, increasing amounts of dysfunction happen
7:43:14
in the stages leading up to it. These sorts of conflicts can exist throughout society, not just in government.
7:43:22
Shown next in our PDFs is how the conflict gauge has changed for the US since the late 1700s, including the
7:43:30
breakdowns between the two sub gauges. What these charts reflect is that the
7:43:35
overall level of conflict within the United States is now as high as it's been since the civil rights and Vietnam
7:43:42
war protests of the late 1960s, but meaningfully less than it was then. The
7:43:48
internal strife index, which mostly reflects demonstrations in the streets, is moderately high. And the political
7:43:55
conflict index is the highest it's been since the early 1920s, when a deep
7:44:00
post-war recession and massive labor unrest contributed to big electoral losses for the
7:44:07
Democrats. In 1919, over 20% of the US labor force went on strike.
7:44:14
Note that the comparable periods before then were the 1900s to 1910s, which saw
7:44:19
a backlash against the robber barons, the rise of the progressive movement, and eventually World War I, and the
7:44:27
1860s when economic and values conflicts led to civil war. The risks are high,
7:44:34
but not unprecedentedly so. Still, the picture should be scary for Americans
7:44:39
and scary for the world because the world's leading power is on the brink and could tip one way or the other.
7:44:47
Fractured conditions within the US are now contributing to instability in other parts of the world. Any worsening would
7:44:54
be at least as disruptive as those past periods. So, what does this all mean for
7:45:00
the US? As I explained in chapter 11, our measures suggest that it is very
7:45:06
roughly 70% through its big cycle. Can it slow or reverse its relative decline?
7:45:13
History shows us that reversing a decline is very difficult because it requires undoing so many things that
7:45:19
have already been done. For example, if one's spending is greater than one's earnings and one's liabilities are
7:45:26
greater than one's assets, those circumstances can only be reversed by working harder or consuming less. The
7:45:34
question is whether we Americans can face our challenges honestly and adapt and change to meet them.
7:45:41
For example, while the capitalist profit-making system allocates resources relatively efficiently, Americans now
7:45:49
need to ask themselves, who is it optimizing these efficiencies for what
7:45:55
should be done if the benefits are not broad-based? Will we modify capitalism
7:46:00
so that it both increases the size of the pie by increasing productivity and
7:46:06
divides it? Well, these questions are especially important to answer in an era when,
7:46:12
thanks to new technologies, employing people will increasingly become unprofitable, inefficient, and
7:46:19
uncompetitive. Should we or should we not invest in people to make them productive even when it's uneconomic to
7:46:27
do so? What if our international competitors choose robots over people?
7:46:33
These and so many more important difficult questions come to mind. But
7:46:38
while we can't know for certain whether the splits and conflicts in the US will increase or reverse, we do know that the
7:46:46
long-term momentum is toward increasing division. And this is a serious risk.
7:46:52
The fact that the US is simultaneously deeply indebted, its international standing is weakening and it is
7:46:58
experiencing serious conflict should be concerning both to Americans and to non-Americans who depend on them. At the
7:47:06
same time, in its 245 year history, the US has shown a great capacity to bend
7:47:12
without breaking. The greatest challenges it faces are internal ones.
7:47:18
Can it remain strong and united or will it continue to allow division and internal struggles to lead to
7:47:26
decline? The external order and disorder cycle. All empires decline and new ones
7:47:34
rise to replace them. Understanding when that change might happen requires
7:47:40
watching all of the indicators and tracking the relative conditions of countries.
7:47:45
Remember from earlier in the book that there are five major types of wars that have existed throughout history. One,
7:47:53
trade economic wars. Two, technology wars. Three, capital wars. Four,
7:48:02
geopolitical wars. And five, military wars.
7:48:07
The external conflict gauge shown in the next PDF measures the levels of
7:48:12
economic, political, and cultural and military conflict between pairs of major
7:48:18
countries. As shown, the greatest conflict is between the US and China. The two greatest powers in the world
7:48:25
that have comparable amounts of power, more than enough to make a war between them the most devastating in history.
7:48:33
The amount of this conflict is one standard deviation above normal, which is pretty severe in relation to past
7:48:40
conflicts between countries. The next PDF chart shows my
7:48:45
index of conflict just between the US and China since
7:48:50
1970. Based on what we've been seeing, the United States and China are clearly
7:48:56
in four types of war. trade, economic war, technology war, capital war, and
7:49:02
geopolitical war. Though not intensely, but they are intensifying. They are not yet in the
7:49:09
fifth type of war, military war, as shown in the previous cases, in
7:49:14
particular, the 1930 to 1945 case. These four types of wars precede military wars
7:49:21
by about 5 to 10 years. Though the risks of military war seem relatively low,
7:49:27
they are increasing. Looking back over the last 500 years, one can see that military
7:49:34
wars between major empires started on average about once every 10 years, give
7:49:39
or take a couple of years. And it has been about 75 years since the last really big one, World War II. Since
7:49:47
1500, major powers have been at war a little bit more than half the time.
7:49:52
There have been just over 50 wars between great powers since 1500 per Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our
7:50:00
Nature 2011. 80% of the years before 1800 had
7:50:05
wars. It's been 20% since. From that perspective, the odds
7:50:10
of a big military war in the next 10 years are about 50/50. But of course,
7:50:16
that's simple-minded. Let's look at the picture a bit more carefully.
7:50:21
The next PDF chart shows the current individual readings of my military strength gauge. While overall these
7:50:28
readings make sense, the US is the most powerful by most measures. China is the
7:50:34
next most powerful, Russia comes next, etc. They don't capture the important
7:50:39
realities beneath these summary numbers. For example, they don't show that some countries are as powerful as or more
7:50:47
powerful than the United States in specific geographic areas, for example, right around China, and in some types of
7:50:54
warfare, for example, space, cyber, etc. Also, they don't consider the effects of
7:51:00
military cooperation and alliances, for example, China and Russia. And they can't account for what unknown military
7:51:07
abilities countries may have. For me, the big headline is that there are lots
7:51:13
of ways these countries can hurt or destroy each other in the most contested geographic
7:51:19
areas. History shows that wars are terribly costly in lives and money, and
7:51:25
the capacity to inflict harm has advanced exponentially since nuclear weapons were developed and used in World
7:51:31
War II. I am unable to imagine what the next military war would look like. I
7:51:38
have also seen that those who are most informed on both sides are not fully informed because a lot is unknown and
7:51:45
because military wars always transpire in unexpected ways. For those reasons,
7:51:51
it is impossible to confidently say who the winners and losers in the next big war would be. We also know from logic
7:51:59
and from studying history that the losers of really big wars are completely wiped out and the winners lose too as
7:52:07
they suffer severe consequences and end up with big debts. What that means for economies and
7:52:13
markets was explained earlier in the audio book. But in a word, it is devastating.
7:52:20
Students of history know that the doctrine of mutually assured destruction prevented the US and the USSR from
7:52:27
entering a hot war before the Soviet Empire fell, mostly due to the failure
7:52:32
to grow its other strengths in the face of big military spending. China is
7:52:38
roughly comparable in power to the United States in the most important ways, and it is on its way to becoming
7:52:44
more powerful in many ways. China won't be as easy to defeat in any
7:52:49
of the five types of war as the USSR was. And the USSR wasn't easy to defeat.
7:52:56
That means the wars are likely to intensify and increasingly favor China,
7:53:01
especially if the US doesn't turn around the other fundamental underpinnings of strength that are highlighted in this
7:53:08
chapter. However, it seems like it will be a long time before China can win a war without
7:53:14
having the war lead to its own destruction as well. So in summary, my computer and I working
7:53:21
together now believe that because for the foreseeable future, China and the US will be powerful enough to inflict
7:53:28
unacceptable harm on each other, the prospect of mutually assured destruction
7:53:33
should prevent military war, though there almost certainly will be dangerous skirmishes. I expect this to be true
7:53:40
unless some unexpected technological breakthrough like dramatic advances in quantum computing gives one of these
7:53:48
powers such an asymmetrical advantage that mutually assured destruction would cease to
7:53:53
exist. Also, though of less importance, an impediment to fighting is the interlin well-being of Americans and the
7:54:00
Chinese in this highly interconnected world. However, as time passes, the
7:54:06
risks increase. If the US continues to decline and China continues to rise,
7:54:12
what matters most is whether or not each can do so gracefully. The big risk is
7:54:17
that when existential irreconcilable differences exist, and there is no mutually agreed upon party or process to
7:54:24
adjudicate the conflict, there is a good chance that there will be a fight. As
7:54:29
explained in the last chapter, the main seemingly irreconcilable difference between the US and China is over Taiwan.
7:54:37
So, I am watching developments there very closely. Taiwan is a one-of-a-kind
7:54:42
interest that China would fight for because of its belief that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.
7:54:50
It is doubtful that the US would consider it worth a major fight to defend. Though it might, this seems to
7:54:57
me to be the only possible trigger for a military war between the two greatest powers in the next 10 years.
7:55:04
The next locations to pay attention to are the areas immediately around China like those countries surrounding the
7:55:11
East and South China seas and other neighbors such as India, Russia, South
7:55:16
Korea, North Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc.
7:55:22
Considering what China's culture is like and what's most beneficial for China, I believe it will work to influence those
7:55:29
countries through an exchange of benefits, but won't fight to control them
7:55:34
outright. While the most important conflicts are between the United States and China, there are other important
7:55:40
players operating in this classic drama of the balance of power and the prisoners dilemma. It is important to
7:55:47
watch the actions of China's and United States allies and friends. As previously
7:55:53
discussed, the alignments are gradually changing with China gaining allies and the United States losing them.
7:56:00
Overextended and less willing to lose lives fighting for others, the US is now in the position of trying to cat herd
7:56:07
its allies without catnip. In the past, the United States merely needed to hint at what it wanted other
7:56:14
countries to do for them to do it. Now they go their own ways. In the end, which country wins the
7:56:21
game of obtaining the most wealth and power depends most on their internal capacities, which is why I monitor those
7:56:29
factors in my indices as I do for military strength. As the Chinese know
7:56:34
very well, and it would be good for others to keep in mind, the best way to fight a war is to get strong and show
7:56:41
one's opponent one's strength so they don't want to fight violently. This will
7:56:46
most likely be the dynamic that we see in the years ahead. All of this is to say that I think the
7:56:52
odds favor intensifying trade and economic wars, technology wars, capital
7:56:58
wars, and geopolitical wars as China becomes even more competitive and increasingly goes global in these areas.
7:57:05
As Graham Allison explained in his excellent book, Destined for War, in the past 500 years, when two nearly equal
7:57:13
powers experienced irreconcilable differences, there were military wars in 12 out of 16 cases, and big military
7:57:21
buildups were associated with major wars in 80 to 90% of cases. We may be seeing
7:57:28
such a buildup now. China's military spending has risen sharply in dollar
7:57:33
terms over the past decade. Though as a share of GDP, it remains relatively
7:57:38
steady at around 2%. At around 3% of GDP, military spending has fallen a bit
7:57:44
for the US. I balance those historical insights with the logic of mutually assured
7:57:51
destruction, which lowers the odds of war. On net, I would conclude that the
7:57:56
probability of a big war in the next 10 years is 35% give or take, which is
7:58:02
essentially a wild guess. In any case, it's a dangerously high
7:58:09
risk. Acts of nature. Throughout history, droughts,
7:58:15
floods, pandemics, and other severe natural and biological disasters have inflicted more harm on people than
7:58:22
people have inflicted on themselves, killing millions, disrupting economies, and contributing to the falls of many
7:58:28
empires and dynasties. The next PDF chart shows some of the major events.
7:58:36
While we all know about climate change, no one knows precisely how much damage
7:58:41
and how many deaths it will ultimately cause. But based on expert projections,
7:58:46
there is reason to believe that all of these kinds of disasters will be bigger in the years ahead than they were
7:58:52
before. While I'm no expert on the subject myself, I can show you some interesting stats and pass along what
7:58:59
I've learned. Please refer to the next PDF charts.
7:59:04
The chart on the right shows the world's average temperature and the amount of CO2 indicating global warming. There is
7:59:12
little doubt this is happening, will pick up and will have big and costly effects. What is notable is this is
7:59:19
increasing at a faster rate. The chart on the left shows the very long-term
7:59:25
perspective on temperature since the year 0 CE. The next PDF chart captures extreme
7:59:32
environmental events. The headline is that from 1970 to 2020, they increased
7:59:39
from fewer than 50 per year to nearly 200 per year and are trending
7:59:45
higher. The following PDF chart shows the estimated dollar cost of these
7:59:50
events adjusted for inflation. As shown, this is also trending higher with
7:59:55
extreme spikes. It is pretty clear to me that humanity and natural evolution together are doing
8:00:03
great damage to the environment that will be very costly in both money and quality of life. This will affect
8:00:10
countries very differently in ways that we can broadly anticipate based on their locations, climates, and most
8:00:17
importantly industries. At the same time, this is a slow, steady, and well- telegraphed
8:00:23
change which lends itself to the kind of adaptation and innovation humanity is uniquely able to do, though often too
8:00:30
slowly and only in response to pain. I am inclined to believe that slowly and
8:00:36
reactively is how it will happen. Having said that, I don't know enough about the
8:00:41
subject to know what it means for every country and locality. The next PDF chart shows an index of
8:00:48
climate change vulnerability across major countries based on an equal average of the Notre Dame Global
8:00:55
Adaptation Index Country Index, which quantifies a country's vulnerability to
8:01:00
climate change and academic estimates of the future impact of climate change on GDP by country.
8:01:09
In summary, based on just these five indicators, it appears to me that
8:01:16
humanity's inventiveness will probably lead to great advances, while the debt economic cycle, the internal order
8:01:24
cycle, the external order cycle, and worsening acts of nature will almost certainly pose problems. In other words,
8:01:31
there will be a battle between humanity's inventiveness and these other challenges.
8:01:37
Very different conditions exist within and between countries which will determine which countries will rise and
8:01:44
decline and in what ways. All of this reflects my thinking
8:01:49
about the future of the world's 11 major countries based on just five of the 18
8:01:55
determinants. Now let's look at all 18 indicators to see what they tell us.
8:02:03
all the major determinants across the world. The following PDF table paints a
8:02:09
much richer picture of what's happening and what is likely to happen across the 11 major countries. While I have many of
8:02:16
these readings for the top 20 countries, I don't have the space to show them here. You can find the complete set at
8:02:23
economicprinciples.org. While this table might look like a bunch of numbers and arrows at first glance,
8:02:31
when you get into it, a clearer picture will emerge. But first, here's how to read
8:02:36
the table and how these gauges work. The first column shows the determinant being
8:02:42
measured. The second rates the quality of the gauge. It is provided because for
8:02:47
some of these important determinants, we have good clear measurements. For example, for education, innovation and
8:02:54
technology, cost competitiveness, productivity and output growth. And for
8:02:59
some, we don't. For example, acts of nature. And I want to show which is
8:03:04
which. Additionally, there are other determinants that aren't shown because they are either too subjective or too
8:03:11
difficult to quantify. For example, leadership. The quality of leadership
8:03:16
can't be measured as objectively as the amount of economic output. For example, how can you measure whether Donald Trump
8:03:23
was a good leader or a bad one? Each is an aggregate of many indicators that I
8:03:28
combined in the way that I felt best captured that particular determinant, giving consideration to both quantity
8:03:35
and quality. For example, a country with a large population like China, India, and the
8:03:41
United States when compared to a country with a small population like Singapore, the Netherlands, and Switzerland might
8:03:48
have more of something but of lesser quality. I tried to structure these
8:03:53
waitings so that I could imagine who would win if they had a competition like the Olympics or a war.
8:04:01
Scanning the table, you can quickly get a picture of each country's circumstances and the overall state of
8:04:06
the world. For example, by looking at the empire scores and the arrows next to
8:04:12
them, you can see that the United States is the most powerful country but declining and China is close behind and
8:04:19
rising quickly. You can see in what ways the United States is exceptionally strong. That is its reserve currency
8:04:26
status, military strength, economic output, innovation and technology and
8:04:32
education. And you can see in what ways it is weak, that is its internal conflicts, wealth gaps, indebtedness and
8:04:40
expected economic growth. You can also see that China is close behind the US in most other key areas
8:04:47
and that it is relatively strong in its infrastructure and investment, innovation and technology, education,
8:04:55
cost competitiveness, economic output, trade, military strength and trade
8:05:01
capital flows and relatively weak because of its reserve currency status,
8:05:06
rule of law, corruption and wealth gaps. I find this data invaluable. It's
8:05:13
crucial to watch for changes in it when thinking about what's happening and what is likely to
8:05:18
happen. For example, as shown before, when one, a country's finances are
8:05:24
deteriorating at the same time as two, the level of internal conflict is high,
8:05:29
for example, over wealth and/or values differences. while three, the country is
8:05:34
being challenged by one or more strong foreign rivals that typically produces
8:05:40
four, a mutually and self-reinforcing decline. That's because the country's
8:05:45
deteriorating finances make it impossible for it to satisfy domestic spending needs and finance the war,
8:05:52
which causes worse outcomes. Now that these things are quantified, we can see them happening in
8:05:58
the table and make projections. The greater the number of important determinants that are worsening and the
8:06:04
more severely they are worsening, the sureer and more severe the decline will be. For example, if a few other
8:06:12
determinants are weak and weakening at the same time that others are faltering, the expected severity of the decline
8:06:19
increases. Because I, with the help of my computer, can monitor such things, I
8:06:24
can assess a country's relative health, vulnerabilities, and future prospects.
8:06:29
For example, many of the most worrying conditions now exist in the United States, even though the United States is
8:06:36
still the most powerful country in the world. That merits close attention. As conveyed in some earlier
8:06:43
charts, we saw that one, these determinants tend to reinforce each other whether in strength, for example,
8:06:50
stronger education tends to create stronger incomes or weakness, for example, weakening trade leads to higher
8:06:57
indebtedness. So they tend to transpire in cycles that come together to create the big cycle.
8:07:04
And two, when the determinants are weak and weakening, the empires are weak and
8:07:09
weakening. Determinants like geology, that is minerals in the ground, are relatively easy to measure, though the
8:07:16
implications of having them might change. Determinants that evolve, like humanity's innovations and technologies,
8:07:24
can typically be seen emerging by watching the trends. Those that transpire in cycles like debt and
8:07:30
capital markets can be understood by understanding the cycles. The fact that
8:07:36
acts of nature like pandemics, droughts, and floods come along shouldn't be a surprise, though their timing often
8:07:44
is. Big swings up occur when lots of determinants are strengthening, and big
8:07:49
swings down occur when lots of determinants are weakening. Our computers use this data to generate
8:07:56
written reports which are available to read at economicprinciples.org. They project
8:08:02
real GDP growth rates for the next 10 years along with the gauge readings for each factor that leads to those
8:08:10
estimates. The data and hence the projections is more reliable for some
8:08:15
countries than others which is conveyed in the readouts. Still, they do a good job of reflecting the current health of
8:08:21
a country and serve as leading indicators of their future health. Based on back testing, these estimates would
8:08:29
have predicted a country's average growth rate over the next decade within 1% of the actual growth 59% of the time
8:08:37
and within 2% about 90% of the time with a correlation to subsequent growth of
8:08:43
81%. I have found them to be invaluable. While these are good and useful
8:08:50
indicators, they have to work hand in hand with my thinking. Consider the question, what is the mix of powers that
8:08:57
makes a country powerful? While the total power index at the top of the current readings tables is intended to
8:09:04
indicate that and is arrived at via a weighted average of the indices below it, the truth is that the type of power
8:09:11
that is most important to have at any one time varies according to circumstances. For example, military
8:09:18
power is expensive and it typically sits around doing nothing until it is the most important power to have. How do I
8:09:25
properly weight that against economic output that consists of mostly non-essentials? The answer is not well.
8:09:33
I don't have it modeled well, but I think about it a lot and apply my experience and intuition to it. In time,
8:09:41
I will have it modeled better. But I know that I will always need to have what is in my head work with what's in
8:09:48
the computer, as the computer and I need each other to be at our
8:09:54
best. The next 10 years. While this book is about the
8:10:00
really big cycles, I'd like to focus now on the dynamics within these cycles that
8:10:05
will be most important over the next 10 years. As I've explained, there are cycles
8:10:11
within cycles within cycles with the little ones adding up to the bigger ones. Plus, there are non-yclical bumps
8:10:18
that altogether determine what happens over the next 10 years. The most
8:10:23
important dynamics are the short-term debt, money, economy cycle, also called
8:10:29
the business cycle, the internal political cycle, and the escalating
8:10:34
conflicts, reducing interdependencies between the US and China. I find that
8:10:39
keeping these cycles in mind, thinking about how they affect each other, and assessing where things stand within them
8:10:46
are helpful for timing my decisions. As discussed in chapter 4, the
8:10:51
short-term debt money economic cycle consists of alternating periods of
8:10:56
central banks stimulating the economy by creating money and credit and then attempting to slow it down by reducing
8:11:03
the flow of them. They never get this precisely right, which is what produces
8:11:09
the excesses that lead to bubbles, busts, and the cycle beginning again.
8:11:14
Sometimes other negative events happen around the same time as a downturn. September 11th, 2001 was such a
8:11:22
case. This cycle typically takes about 8 years, give or take a few, though the
8:11:27
timing is less the result of how long it's been since the last one, and more the result of the underlying economic
8:11:34
drivers themselves. Most importantly, the amount of slack in the economy, the amounts and
8:11:40
types of financial bubbles, the amount of central bank tightening, and the markets and economy's sensitivity to
8:11:47
tightening all matter. The last cycle began in April 2020 with the largest
8:11:54
dose of fiscal and monetary stimulation ever. The one before that began in 2008,
8:12:00
which was also a giant dose, though much less big. The ones before that began in
8:12:06
2001, 1990, 1982, 1980,
8:12:12
1974, 1970, 1960, etc. With the amounts of stimulation injected into this recent
8:12:19
downturn being so enormous, especially in the US, with the slack in the major
8:12:25
economies being relatively limited, especially in the US, with the signs of bubbles now being moderate to strong,
8:12:32
and with the interest rate sensitivity of markets and the economy being high, my guess is that the next downturn will
8:12:40
come sooner than is typical. I'd estimate in about four years from the publication of this book, give or take a
8:12:47
couple of years, which is about 5 and a half years from the bottom. Don't bet on what I just said
8:12:54
happening because that configuration is not precise. I will need to monitor the
8:12:59
factors I just mentioned, especially the rate of rebound in inflation and how quick and strong central bank tightening
8:13:06
will be in order to home in on the precise timing. Also, I would expect any downturn to be
8:13:13
promptly followed by a quick reversal of central bank policies toward the next big round of
8:13:19
stimulation. That makes me less worried about the impact of the downturn and more worried about the excess money
8:13:26
printing and the loss of value of money, particularly cash and debt in dollars,
8:13:31
euros, and yen. Of course, what happens in this economic cycle will be affected
8:13:37
by what happens with the other cycles and the bumps along the way. Just as this cycle will affect the other
8:13:44
cycles. As far as the internal order disorder cycle is concerned, it
8:13:49
typically lags the debt economic cycle because people are less confrontational in good times than in bad ones. When
8:13:57
these cycles interact strongly, it can lead to major changes. In the US, the
8:14:02
short-term political cycles of change come every 2 years with congressional elections and every four years with
8:14:08
presidential elections with an 8-year limit on the total presidential term. In
8:14:14
China, the changes come every 5 and 10 years with the next big one happening around the time of this book's
8:14:20
publication, November 2021. There is no limit on the presidential term. While we can look at
8:14:28
the calendars and know something about what's ahead, there will be lots of uncertainties, some of which can be
8:14:34
really impactful. Based on my estimates, there is a significant chance the next
8:14:39
downturn will come around the time of the next presidential election in the US. The external order disorder cycle
8:14:47
has traditionally followed the path of accelerating conflicts that lead to wars. As mentioned earlier, the United
8:14:54
States and China are now preparing themselves for increasing intensity in the five types of war. They are
8:15:01
operating with roughly 5-year plans to gain greater amounts of self-sufficiency and preparedness for each of these wars,
8:15:08
which will give them greater ability to wage them. Though, it's doubtful that either will become dominant enough to
8:15:14
ignore the deterrent of mutually assured destruction. Since China's strength is
8:15:19
gaining relative to that of the US, it would seem to imply that important changes will come neither too soon nor
8:15:26
too far ahead. As mentioned earlier, there is significant risk that we are
8:15:32
approaching a conflict between an unstoppable force and an immovable object regarding Taiwan and the East and
8:15:38
South China seas. That is, China is an unstoppable force for change to Taiwan's
8:15:44
current status and the United States is an immovable object against it. Beyond
8:15:50
the US and China, other nations, most notably Russia, India, Japan, Korea, and
8:15:56
the key European and Middle Eastern powers will play important roles in this global drama. Over the next 5 years or
8:16:03
so, alliances are likely to harden. These things point toward the next big
8:16:09
risk point being around 5 years from this writing, give or take a couple of
8:16:15
years. To reiterate, there is nothing precise about the timing of these cycles. They're like hurricane typhoon
8:16:22
seasons. We know they are likely to happen at roughly certain times, so we prepare for them. And when those times
8:16:29
come, we watch for storms emerging, follow them closely, and do our best to get out of harm's way. While we can't
8:16:36
say exactly when they will come and exactly how strong they will be, we do know that the trend and the fundamentals
8:16:43
have been for them to get stronger. So, we should be prepared for that possibility. Despite all the analytical
8:16:50
work I do, I know that the unknown is still much greater than the known. While
8:16:56
history can be told pretty precisely, the future is exactly the opposite. I am
8:17:01
not aware of a single case of the future being foretold accurately in any detail.
8:17:06
For an investor, understanding history accurately is of no use relative to being a bit more right than wrong about
8:17:14
the future. Since non-investors place bets in the form of their life decisions, that's true for them, too.
8:17:22
That brings me to the final point of this chapter, which is about knowing how to place one's bets based on the
8:17:28
assumption that one is likely to be wrong a lot. Dealing with what you know and what
8:17:36
you don't know. Thanks, Jeremy. I'll take it from here.
8:17:43
Whatever success I've had has been more due to my knowing how to deal with what
8:17:48
I don't know than anything I know. Betting on the future is betting on
8:17:54
probabilities and nothing is certain, not even the probabilities. That's just the way it
8:18:01
is. While what I've given you up until this point is what I believe I know about the
8:18:08
future based on my reasoning about the past, what I want to pass along that is
8:18:14
probably more important is how to make decisions in life and in the markets
8:18:20
based on what I don't know. In a nutshell, here's what I try to
8:18:27
do. First, know all the possibilities. Think about the worst case scenarios and
8:18:34
then find ways to eliminate the intolerable ones. Identifying and eliminating the
8:18:41
intolerable worst case scenarios comes first. That's because the most important
8:18:48
thing in playing the game of life and the markets is not getting knocked out
8:18:54
of it. I learned that from a big mistake I made in 1982 which nearly broke
8:19:01
me. After that painful loss, I calculated what my basic needs would
8:19:07
cost and worked toward having enough money stashed away so my worst case
8:19:13
scenario would be tolerable. As I built up from nothing, I
8:19:18
remember regularly calculating how many weeks, then months, and then years my
8:19:26
family and I would be fine if not another dime came in. I now have an end
8:19:32
of the world portfolio that I know will keep us fine in the worst case scenarios
8:19:39
and I build from there. From listening to this book, you probably can see that I imagine a lot of
8:19:45
worst case scenarios, including depressions, devaluations, revolutions, wars, pandemics, my big mistakes, health
8:19:53
problems, and death from different causes. I start by trying to protect
8:19:58
myself against all of them and more. While you might think that my paying so
8:20:04
much attention to eliminating worst case scenarios is depressing and prevents me
8:20:09
from making the most of opportunities, the opposite is true. It's liberating
8:20:15
and exciting to operate this way because knowing that the worst case scenarios
8:20:21
are covered gives me the safety, freedom, and ability to go for great
8:20:26
results. Second, I want to diversify. In addition to making sure
8:20:35
I've covered all the worst case scenarios I can think of, I try to cover those I can't think of by diversifying
8:20:43
well. I learned the math of it and I'm drawn to it instinctively.
8:20:50
Essentially, if I have a bunch of bets that are attractive but unrelated, I can
8:20:55
reduce my risk by up to 80% without reducing my upside at
8:21:01
all. While this sounds like an investment strategy, it's actually an
8:21:06
old and wellestablished good life strategy that I apply to investments as
8:21:12
well. There's a Chinese saying that a smart rabbit has three burrows, meaning three
8:21:19
places to go in case any one of them becomes dangerous. This principle has saved many
8:21:25
people's lives when things got bad, and it's one of my most important
8:21:31
principles. Another principle is to put deferred gratification ahead of
8:21:36
immediate gratification so you will be better off in the future.
8:21:42
Another one is triangulate among the smartest people possible. I tag along with the smartest
8:21:50
people I can find so I can stress test my thinking and learn from them. It is through these principles
8:21:57
that I got so much upside with relatively little downside and a
8:22:02
steadily improving future, albeit with bumps along the way. That's why I
8:22:08
recommend these principles to you. So, as always, feel free to take or leave them as you
8:22:14
like. One more thing for policy makers, those they report to and others who are
8:22:21
interested. Use the gauges I gave you or take the stats and make your own to one,
8:22:29
measure the health of your country and the other countries you're interested in.
8:22:35
Two, see if it is improving or worsening and in what
8:22:41
ways. And three, make changes in the determinance
8:22:47
of the future to get a better future. That's
8:22:53
it. I now feel that doing all of this has given me an adequate understanding of the
8:22:59
possibilities, both worst case scenarios and opportunities.
8:23:04
and a time-tested plan for dealing with them. Well, I also believe that I have
8:23:11
adequately conveyed to you in this audio book and on economic
8:23:16
principles.org the most important things I know about how the lessons of the past
8:23:23
can help you deal with the future. I hope you will find them of some use. I plan to evolve all of this
8:23:31
to make it better, which I hope we can do together. May the force of evolution be
8:23:38
with you. More detail on each of the
8:23:46
gauges. Education. This gauge measures basic and higher education split about evenly
8:23:53
between the two. Half of the measure captures the absolute quantity of educated people at various levels and
8:24:00
about half is placed on quality such as higher education rankings, test scores
8:24:06
and average years of education. The US ranks highest in this gauge driven by
8:24:11
strong absolute and relative measures of higher education with China close behind
8:24:17
due to its large number of educated people. Innovation and
8:24:23
technology. This gauge measures inventiveness, technological advancement and
8:24:28
entrepreneurship. It gives about half its weight to the country's absolute share of key innovation metrics. For
8:24:35
example, patents, researchers, R&D spending and venture capital funding,
8:24:40
and half to a combination of external rankings and measures of innovation per
8:24:45
capita to help capture how widespread innovation is in the economy. The US is
8:24:51
at the top of this measure due to its strength across a variety of metrics. While China ranks second due to its
8:24:58
large share of global research spending, researchers and patents. China is rising
8:25:03
quickly in this area. Cost competitiveness. This gauge measures
8:25:10
what one gets for what one pays. We want to see this because countries that
8:25:15
produce the best at costs that are too expensive aren't in good shape. Even though they rank high in quality, we
8:25:22
look at quality adjusted and productivity adjusted labor costs along with other productivity measures. Major
8:25:29
developing economies, particularly India, rank highest in this gauge while the US ranks around the middle of the
8:25:36
pack and European countries rank lowest due to high labor
8:25:41
costs. Infrastructure and investment. This gauge measures the
8:25:46
quantity of infrastructure and investment spending and the quality of it. It captures a country's absolute
8:25:53
share of global investment as well as the extent to which a country prioritizes quality of infrastructure
8:25:59
and productivity enhancing investments. The gauge weighs measures of investment as a share of world investment, overall
8:26:06
infrastructure quality, investment and savings as a share of GDP and logistics
8:26:12
performance. China is currently the strongest according to this gauge having risen sharply over the past 20 years
8:26:19
because of its high rates of productive investment relative to both the world and the size of its own past investment.
8:26:27
The US is second due largely to its high share of global productive investment
8:26:32
though it is worsening. Economic output. This gauge measures the strength
8:26:39
of a country's economic resources. We measure output primarily through GDP
8:26:44
levels as a share of world total adjusted for price differences across countries. We allocate some weight to
8:26:51
GDP per capita rather than total GDP to capture quality. China ranks first in
8:26:57
this gauge insignificantly ahead of the US but also rising fastest due to its
8:27:03
large PPP adjusted GDP share. Europe ranks third.
8:27:09
Expected growth, big economic cycle. This gauge measures how well a
8:27:15
country is positioned to grow its economy over the next 10 years. We look at a variety of metrics to estimate
8:27:22
forward-looking 10-year economic growth, placing 2/3 weight on metrics that
8:27:27
predict productivity and 1/3 on metrics that predict the impact of indebtedness
8:27:32
on growth. Currently, India is predicted to grow the fastest, followed by China,
8:27:38
with the US predicted to grow a bit slower than average, and with Japan and a number of European countries predicted
8:27:44
to grow least. Trade. This gauge measures how strong of
8:27:50
an exporter a country is. It looks at the absolute level of a country's exports as a share of the world. China
8:27:57
scores highest, being the largest exporter in the world, followed by Europe and the US.
8:28:04
Military strength. This gauge is driven mostly by the absolute share of military spending
8:28:11
and strength measured by the number of personnel, the number of nuclear weapons and external indices of military
8:28:18
capabilities. It does not look at military powers in varying regions or of various types failing to capture some
8:28:26
military superiorities Russia and China have in certain geographic areas.
8:28:31
certain types of military technologies or the role of alliances. The US is
8:28:36
still the strongest overall military power based on these measures with a strong lead in spending and a nuclear
8:28:43
weapons program that is only rivaled by Russia. China is now ranked second and
8:28:48
is rising quickly. Financial center. This gauge measures the level of
8:28:55
development and sizes of a country's financial markets and financial center. We look at absolute measures of
8:29:02
transaction shares and market capitalizations as well as external indices of financial center cities. The
8:29:09
US remains the top ranked power in this metric by a significant margin driven primarily by its very large share of
8:29:16
world equity and debt markets with China and Europe ranking second and third
8:29:23
respectively. Reserve currency status. This gauge measures the extent to which
8:29:28
a country's currency operates as a global reserve currency. We measure reserve currency status by the share of
8:29:36
transactions, debts, and central bank reserves that are denominated or held in a country's currency. Similar to
8:29:43
financial center status, the US remains the top ranked power in this metric by a
8:29:48
significant margin with Europe and Japan ranking second and third respectively.
8:29:55
Debt burden big economic cycle. This gauge is based on a
8:30:00
combination of A debt levels relative to asset levels. B the sizes of external
8:30:06
and internal surpluses and deficits, C the sizes of debt service costs relative
8:30:12
to GDP, D the amount of debt in a country's own currency versus foreign currency. E
8:30:20
the amount of debt held by its own citizens versus foreigners. and f its
8:30:25
credit rating. We composed it this way because it has proven itself to be the most reliable way we have of
8:30:31
foreshadowing declines in the value of real wealth. Whether they come in the form of debt defaults that result from
8:30:38
not creating enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs or devaluations that come from creating
8:30:45
more than enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs. I constructed this index to exclude
8:30:51
reserve currency status so that I could see the exposure a country would have if it lost its reserve currency
8:30:59
status. Internal conflict internal order. This gauge looks at how much
8:31:05
domestic conflict and discontent there is. It measures actual conflict events,
8:31:11
for example, protests, political conflict, for example, partisanship, and
8:31:16
general discontent based on surveys. The US ranks highest in this gauge among the
8:31:22
major countries driven by measures of partisanship and higher incidence of internal conflict events and it has been
8:31:28
rising fast. Governance, rule of law.
8:31:34
This gauge measures the extent to which a country's legal system is consistent, predictable, and conducive to growth and
8:31:41
advancement. It combines rule of law measures based primarily on business surveys of doing business in the country
8:31:48
and corruption measures via a combination of external corruption indices and surveys of businesses.
8:31:55
Russia and India score lowest worst on the gauge while the UK, the Netherlands
8:32:01
and Japan score highest best with Germany and the US close
8:32:06
behind. Geology. This gauge measures each country's geographic endowment including
8:32:13
land size and the value of its natural resources. It includes the total production of energy, agriculture, and
8:32:20
industrial metals in order to capture the absolute production capacity of each nation as well as net exports to capture
8:32:28
relative self-reliance for each of the categories. In addition to measuring some other natural resources like
8:32:34
freshwater supply, Russia and the US score highest, followed by China, which relies more on
8:32:41
the rest of the world to cover its natural resource needs, while Japan and the UK score
8:32:48
lowest. Gaps in wealth, opportunity, and values. This gauge measures how big the
8:32:55
gaps in wealth, income, opportunities, and values are. It combines measures of
8:33:01
both a wealth and income inequality for example how much does the top 1% have
8:33:06
versus the rest and b political conflict for example how split is the legislature
8:33:12
on ideology India the US and China score worst because of very large wealth and
8:33:19
income gaps and in the case of the US also significant political gaps at the
8:33:24
other end of the spectrum are the European nations and Japan which generally speaking have lower income and
8:33:30
wealth inequality. Character civility
8:33:35
determination. This gauge attempts to measure to what extent the attitudes of each country's people create an
8:33:41
environment that's supportive to civility and hard work, which supports growth and advancement. It uses a
8:33:48
surveys around attitudes toward working hard and success, and b other measures
8:33:53
that proxy how much a society values self-sufficiency and work. For example,
8:33:58
government transfer payment size, effective retirement age. To quantify this, China and India score highest, the
8:34:06
US is third, and the European countries, notably Spain and France, score
8:34:13
lowest. Resource allocation efficiency. This gauge attempts to
8:34:18
measure how efficiently each country is using its labor and capital. It looks at
8:34:23
whether the country has chronically high unemployment, that is not finding efficient ways to employ its people. If
8:34:30
debt growth generates commensurate income growth over time, and external indices and surveys about the rigidity
8:34:37
of the labor market and ease of getting loans. Much of Europe, particularly
8:34:42
France and Spain, score lowest on these measures, while the US and Germany score near the top. Developing countries
8:34:49
particularly Russia but also China and India also score fairly well in this
8:34:55
measure as generally speaking they produce more income growth per unit of debt
8:35:00
growth. Acts of nature. This gauge measures how vulnerable to and impacted by acts of
8:35:08
nature each country is. While it is difficult to quantify all the various acts of nature that might affect a
8:35:14
country, we used expert assessments of future climate change impact on each country's GDP, external assessments of
8:35:22
each country's preparedness for natural disasters and the outcomes from the COVID pandemic as that was a realtime
8:35:29
test against an act of nature. I consider this rating so and find that
8:35:35
there is still a lot more we want to capture to make this gauge better. Hence its low
8:35:41
quality external conflict. While not a part of the model for individual countries, the external
8:35:48
conflict gauge measures the levels of economic, political, cultural, and military conflict between pairs of major
8:35:55
countries. Within each category, we tried to come up with a mix of structural indicators to establish a
8:36:02
baseline level of conflict between countries and timely indicators to flag major escalations above that baseline.
8:36:10
For example, for economic conflict, we track bilateral trade between countries,
8:36:15
tariff rates, and timely news around sanctions, trade wars, etc.
