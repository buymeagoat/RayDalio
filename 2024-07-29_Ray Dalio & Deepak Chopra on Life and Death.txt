I'm deak Chopra and I trained as a internist medical doctor endocrinologist
0:15
and neuroendocrinologist my current u u
0:22
journey is exploring Consciousness and what we call reality if you don't know
0:27
who radi Al is then you're probably asleep he's the most well-known figure
0:34
in the financial world uh an entrepreneur since the age of
0:40
12 and still grooming entrepreneurs not only in the United
0:46
States but his influence is global he's got these amazingly extraordinary books
0:53
that have been reading recently this is the big one principles by R Dalo
1:00
and there if you are in intimidated by something this big then this is a good
1:07
summary of all the principles that have created the legend
1:12
the mythology the U the story that we call
1:19
ralo so thanks very much for joining me today oh thank you for having me it's a
1:25
delight because as I read through your principles I think you're the practical iCal Western
1:32
version of some of the deepest insights that come to us from the wisdom
1:38
traditions of the world both east and west and you know bringing these two
1:43
paradigms together East and West defining success defining how we
1:50
achieve our goals is what everybody wants
We Come from Different Worlds and See the Same Life Truths
2:00
my name is Ray alio um I come from an entirely different world uh from deepo
2:07
um and have admired him from afar as vice versa because it's remarkable that
2:14
from these different worlds uh we learn that reality works the same way so when
2:22
we in our conversations you hear these descriptions of how reality works and
2:27
how we should approach it to get the best results possible and so what I'm really excited about is as we explore
2:35
this as these common truths and we can share it with other people so that they
2:40
can realize they're not just within our worlds you're a contributor to the world the universe to others in that way and
2:49
you're wise so that you bring wisdom to other
2:55
people and so you have what I would describe as the heart and the mind and
3:03
the wisdom to be a net contributor to Evolution and goodness and so you're
3:11
enlightening um as well as um radiating uh qualities that uh feel good
3:21
and also contribute to good well what I admire about you is you're authentic you
3:26
are not pretending to be who you're not you have integrity you have always
3:32
displayed to the world that you live up to what you call your
3:39
principles you have a higher purpose and you're real I think that's
3:45
the most important thing I mean you know one of the reflections we do in our daily meditation
3:51
practice is who am I what do I want what's my purpose and what am I grateful
3:58
for so may ask Ray who you are what do you want what's your purpose and what
4:05
you're grateful
The Force of Evolution
4:11
for well my purpose uh is to evolve and contribute to evolution in a nutshell um
4:20
in other words um I'm part of a greater ecosystem um and I change and everything
4:30
changes and so the greatest Force to me is the force of un of
4:36
evolution uh and so I'm part of evolution and I'm evolving and trying to
4:42
contribute to Evolution and you've been an entrepreneur since the age of 12 I was reading a biography and you made
4:48
your first investment at the age of 12 and uh you never look
4:55
back well life is a journey that we each bump into you know we we start off we
5:03
have our nature you have a nature I have a nature and then there's a journey
5:09
things catch our attention and we try to line our nature up with a path and so I
5:16
stumbled on markets I used to caddy and earned some money and I stumbled on markets I loved it and I Evol what was
5:24
your Evolution up until 12 my Evolution being brought up in in India uh up until
5:31
12 was being brought up by a father who was a uh colonel in
5:40
the British army but he was also an MD he was a fellow of the Royal College
5:45
of Physicians so he was very Western my mother was a
5:51
Storyteller uh she had little education didn't go to college or anything but she
5:58
would read story stories from the actually sing stories to me and my
6:04
little brother who later went on to become the dean for education at Harvard
6:10
Medical School but I remember even now when I was five and he was three
6:16
sitting on her lap and she would she would actually sing stories of
6:22
superheroes and superh heroins from the great mythical traditions of the world
6:29
and then she would stop at night this was before we went to
6:34
bed she would stop at what uh today the entertainment World calls a cliffhanger
6:41
so everything was wrong everything was wrong and
6:46
chaotic and the bad guys were winning and the good guys were losing and there
6:53
was no hope and she would stop and she would say now I want you to dream of
7:00
the rest of the story make it a love story for sure because no story is good
7:05
unless it's a love story and it should have a happy ending and believe it or
7:11
not in the morning we had the solution to all the crisis that were going on on
7:17
the other hand my father was very you know he was a datadriven
7:23
cardiologist and so it I got exposed to both words so I'm I'm sure it is for you
7:28
like uh me when we look at it um this is a um story that
7:38
started an eternity ago that uh began with genetics and environments correct
7:45
so as you find yourself born and then in
7:51
this environment you have your genetics and your environment and then that
7:57
shapes you as part of the story and then you go on and we go on and Destiny kind
8:04
of brings us to where we are and that is the process of our Evolution and so when
8:12
we look at it we go above it and we look down on it our conversations do that yes it it's
8:22
um it's a unique way of looking at it but it's really an accurate way of
8:27
looking at it when I think of our both of us uh we come from radically
8:33
different worlds radically different backgrounds and yet we see almost
8:39
everything identically almost everything identically and we and that means we see
8:46
how the world works and how the best ways of interacting with it are by and
8:52
large and that's what's interesting about this don't you think it's very interesting because two completely
8:58
different stories and yet an intersection with those stories which we
9:05
are a person is nothing other than a story to be a human is to have a story
9:12
and yet our stories interact and we discover the same principles but but
9:18
that's because um they're right I mean meaning as you go above it correct I
9:24
meditate correct and you meditate I know that and as we both meditate I think it
9:30
helps us to some extent Ascend and and to look at everything and down on it and
9:35
there it is and how does it work and how should one interact with
Embracing Reality
9:45
it yeah that witnessing that comes with the ability to meditate and reflect and
9:52
that brings me here to you know your book where essentially you
10:00
you know how you guide us on how this journal works and the principle is think
10:07
for yourself to decide what you want what is true and what you should do to
10:13
achieve one in light of number two and then you know you go uh on with your
10:20
first principle which I really loved and that is your first uh reflection here
10:29
that pain plus reflection is progress so as I
10:34
was reading your bio I realized that you became very successful very quickly and
10:41
then um you know you testified before the US Congress that there was going to be a
10:47
depression you were wrong um you lost all your money you had
10:53
to borrow $44,000 from your parents and that's an example
11:00
that was one of the best things that ever happened to me pain plus failure and reflection so you had this huge
11:06
failure after being wildly successful very early on in your life you had to
11:11
borrow $4,000 from your parents and he started to reflect on
11:17
this and he came up with this very interesting principle which we just
11:22
mentioned that pain plus u reflection is
11:27
equal to progress uh so there is no such thing as failure
11:34
failure is an opportunity for evolution as you've been saying and that mindset helped you
11:41
create Bridgewater right yeah I think I think it's a journey for everybody right
11:46
um you start off and you encounter
11:54
reality and if everything goes well then I suppose you don't need to learn much
12:00
but that's not the way it goes it's boring actually it's almost like it's
12:05
like a pendulum swinging only one way yeah be it would be
12:10
boring um and it also isn't just the way it is yeah and so you encounter life
12:16
it's almost like a video game you know except with real pain and real pleasure
12:21
so you encounter it and then reflect on how does reality work and how
12:29
should I interact with it I think one of the big problems about a lot of
12:34
people is they form an expectation of how reality should
12:41
be and they get upset if it's not that way which is so silly because reality is
12:49
reality and so that process of struggling and falling and learning is
12:57
just the way it is right life life is like that you know I remember in the
13:02
early days when uh I learned meditation and you I know have practiced Mantra
13:10
meditation uh and I first met you know the man the guru who brought TM to the
13:17
world and we were at a conference at Harvard with medical doctors
13:23
Etc and they all kept saying you know how to manage stress and then then uh
13:30
what happened very interestingly is that after everybody left he called me and he
13:35
whispered in my ear said what is this thing that they're calling stress and I
13:43
said it's a perception of threat which is our definition and
13:49
sence and he kind of looked up and he said something that you would relate to
13:54
he said Oh you mean it's resistance to existence what good quote there you are
14:01
so when you resist existence then you're not being real and that's what he said to be real
14:08
is to go with existence and existence and experience of existence by
14:15
contrast you can't have an up without a down you can't have a hot without a cold you can't have pain without pleasure you
14:21
wouldn't know what it is so when you say that reality is what we confront most most
14:29
people don't confront reality and that's why they're stressed yeah very well put
14:34
yeah I uh I think it's all part of that evolutionary process uh
14:42
expectations yes the world doesn't meet up to your expectations you think there
14:48
that's a problem yeah so as looking at your first
What is Success and How to Achieve it
14:57
reflection here pain Plus reflection equals progress and that U we have to confront
15:04
reality in order to achieve our goals I've always thought of success as the
15:10
progressive realization of worthy goals but also as the ability to love to have
15:17
compassion but also always be in touch with our own creative
15:23
Center and as I was looking again at your book mentioning the
15:30
fstep process for what it takes to getting what you want
15:35
out of life is looking at this diagram which is very very telling
15:42
goals and then you go from goals to problems to diagnosis to design and then
15:49
action doing that's been your mod op rending
15:55
it's obviously worked for you very much well first of all I think that um
16:01
there's no one um path to success in life so that um I think there are
16:09
common things meaningful work meaningful relationships I think um which are
16:15
obtained in certain ways but um what we
16:21
each want is extension of our nature as we pursue that and so we can't say that
16:28
any thing is the right thing but as we look at reality we can say um that we
16:36
have to accept reality and then it's a fact that the world is a happier place
16:43
and we are happier people um if we love each other and if we're good to each
16:50
other and a win-win relationship is the is the best thing I use the word love um
16:57
I think different people mean different things by love so I'm almost afraid to use it but it's the notion that if your
17:03
well-being is something that's important to me and the well-being of us together
17:10
is something that's important to us and we contribute to that we will get back
17:16
more than we gave because we each can help each other in different ways and
17:23
not only will we have a better functional existence getting whatever we want out of life in that path but we
17:30
will also have the joy of that that you know
17:36
the there feels good to like each other it feels good to be kind of in that
17:42
environment and so I think that that's a Timeless and universal truth you
17:53
know if you look at um happiness study iies have shown there's
18:00
no correlation in happiness um related to money past a
18:05
certain basic level the highest correlation with happiness is a sense of
18:10
community correct and so that's a universal truth we share that kind of view just out of
18:18
observations of how it works right yeah I was reading up I mean everybody has of
18:24
course their version of truth but use the very nice expression universal truth
18:30
I think universal truth is that which never changes otherwise our personal
18:37
perspectives keep changing as we evolve getting closer to universal truth but
18:43
the fact that we're social beings in The Matrix of relationship is a universal truth there
18:50
are time Timeless and Universal truths cor right and uh for example I asked uh
18:58
Chad GPT um what would be the common religion
19:04
in other words what is in common if I have Christianity Judaism Islam Hinduism
19:12
Buddhism um Confucianism and it tells the universal
19:18
truth truths in a sense the universal beliefs and those are not like be good
19:26
and so on they're very practical very practical beliefs that some people
19:31
believe are um just kind of this Flim Flam um theoretical flower child thing
19:39
rather than actual practicalities in terms of having a better life correct so
19:45
then you put down these what you were reflecting on universal truths here in principles and there's a
19:54
lovely guide also and what I realized is that you first put them on your website
20:02
and the Bridgewater website and then slowly turned into a book and
20:08
now first of all the principles were downloaded more than 3 million times and
20:16
2017 they were published as a book principles life and work but that's no
20:21
different that's no different than you okay then what's interesting is that they're the same truths
20:28
we hope there are Universal truths well as we look at it yes um and I
20:36
look and I look at uh your laws okay the law of pure potentiality the
20:44
law of giving the law of karma the law of least
20:49
effort the law of intention and desire The Law of
20:55
Detachment the law of Dharma meaning purpose yeah and I go through
21:02
those they're the they're the same and I just want to again have us
21:11
and our audiences understand that those are
21:16
not those are practical and so they're they're the
21:21
same when we talk about any of them you could pick any of
21:27
them we just talked about for example
21:32
U you can call it karma or you can call it do unto others as you would have them
21:37
do unto you or you can call it by any other names but it works better almost
21:45
whatever your goal is it works better than selfishness it works be and it makes a
21:52
better hole and it's more joyous it just works better yeah
Seeing Yourself as Part of the Whole
22:02
you know when I was writing that book uh as a practicing physician was looking at
22:09
our biology as a model so we all start out as one cell
22:16
one fertilized egg call it what you will stem cell PL
22:21
potential cell but all it does is multiply 50 times 50 times only to
22:28
produce the 60 trillion cells in your body which are more than all the stars
22:35
in the Milky Way galaxy and now you know when I look at a body I look at your eyes and your nose and your heart and
22:43
your brain and your finger nails they all seem very different but they came from that one cell amazing so that one
22:50
cell had almost infinite potential in our case it turned into a
22:56
human being but it could be a plur potential cell for creating a monkey or
23:03
a primate or a butterfly or a snake so at the at the deepest level we are that
23:12
one Whatever mysterious entity call it God Spirit Divine
23:20
intelligence but differentiation is not separation it's you know this thing
23:26
doesn't think it's different from this otherwise your body would fall apart you know how does a human body think
23:32
thoughts play a piano kill germs remove a toxins make a baby all at the same time while tracking the movement of
23:39
stars and planets because your biological rhythms are the Symphony of the whole universe that's what we call
23:45
it you neighbors one song So as I was thinking about this I said you know if my cells can be like
23:51
that my cells have infinite potential my cells are constantly giving to each
23:58
other my stomach is not saying why should digest food for the heart but the
24:03
heart is not saying why should I pump blood for the brain or the brain is saying why shouldn't I be the master
24:09
computer for everyone what's in it for me so giving is
24:15
there karma is there as you said do unto others least effort you know Jesus said
24:23
actually uh for do not worry about tomorrow in one of his parables
24:29
you know that the birds and the bees have a better time than you because they're not concerned about tomorrow
24:35
words to that effect least effort intention every cell has a unique
24:42
intention without that intention there would be no manifestation if cells were attached to
24:50
their performance they wouldn't be able to function they you know cells work
24:55
only in the present there's no past or future of our cells and every cell has meaning and purpose
25:02
and which is the Integrity of the whole so that's how I actually came up with these and it was nothing original when I
25:09
looked up the wisdom Traditions it's all there as you said in every spiritual tradition in the world the same things
25:15
exist well I um I saw this fabulous exhib exhibition on the
25:23
brain um which by the way was not the human brain
25:28
it was the brain of all species brain
25:34
the evolution of the brain at the American Museum of Natural History and
25:40
um the brain is constructed the same way for all species basically in terms of um
25:50
the various layers to it and then you go up to the prefrontal cortex and you
25:57
start to to extrapolate so for all animals um it's like a car okay there
26:06
are car sports cars and there are SUVs and all different and so a bird's brain
26:12
will have a better optical nerve and so on but they're basically all the same and if you look at the evolution of the
26:20
brain over a period of time across species and by the way man is only one
26:25
of 10 million species okay so now as we have that Evolution
26:32
and there's a commonality to it which is what your thoughts have triggered to me
26:37
as that Evolution happens you see that you go to higher levels of abstraction and greater levels of the
26:45
capacity to empathize and think of the greater whole and so now I think it's
26:52
almost a trajectory toward what I would consider God okay okay we all Define it
26:59
differently but that in a sense that greater Consciousness in which we
27:06
are looking at the whole and we look Beyond
27:11
ourselves so when we if we can get there in that trajectory that to me is an
27:20
ascendancy that extends beyond the humans in a sense it's part of that
27:26
evolutionary process and the real question is can we look at the hole so you mentioned
27:32
chat GPT earlier I also went to chat CPT and some recently some other Advanced AI
27:41
which they say is beyond Superior to CH G yes it's just evolving it's evolving
27:48
right so I asked XYZ XYZ so I asked uh
27:53
what are the most uh what are the most healing emotions that we can have as human
28:02
beings of course empathy compassion love uh Joy equinity which are in wisdom
28:13
Traditions called Divine emotions but then you know my my a I said the most
28:21
profound emotions are awe or wonder or mystery of
28:31
bewilderment and you know they came across this poem of roomi says exchange your cleverness for bewilderment oh yes
28:38
you know once you're bewildered there's no choice than to be full of awe and
28:44
mystery and humility which you mention a lot in your books many many
28:49
people because of a sort of a screwed up system um of education and raising and
28:55
so on uh value no so much that it stands in the way of a
29:03
taking things in and curiosity in other words don't you you don't
29:09
know people feel like almost guilty that they don't know rather than
29:17
if yes awe and curiosity and it's thrilling and what we
29:23
don't know is much greater than what we do know so yes we agree on that right at
29:28
awe it's thrilling and observing life all the stages of life and nature
29:35
reality is incredibly beautiful and it's a wonderful thing to try to understand
29:41
with others I see a lot of uh entrepreneurs
Advice for Entrepreneurs
29:50
young people who come to me thinking I could Mentor them but U they're talking
29:58
about exit strategy even before they've started a business like you know
30:04
dividing the loot before there's a train that can be robbed and they talk about
30:10
exit strategy they exit this exit that you know I said where's the joy in all
30:15
this and they haven't even thought of it I asked them have you do you realize
30:20
that there's a final exit strategy it's called Death are you going to be talking about
30:27
all your exits or are you going to be talking about having lived a joyful meaningful life and it's very surprising
30:35
to me that they haven't even reflected on that question now I'm sure you're a role model for so
30:42
many uh young people who want to be like you they're thinking by being like you
30:48
means extraordinary rich but they're not looking at these deeper
30:54
questions so what would you say to all these young entrepreneurs who are you
31:00
know wanting to be successful businessman because you are not one of the most sucessful problem I think that
31:06
I just ran into a game that I love and it happens to pay well if
31:13
you're good at it that's that's all it was I didn't go after that and I think here's what I would say um money has no
31:19
intrinsic value money um what does it get you you
31:27
have to think what does it get you and I think um you should pick whatever is
31:34
brings you the most happy life you have and you should be what I call
31:39
self-sufficient plus that means you H have to have
31:46
enough money to have the life that you want to have um and maybe a little bit
31:53
more so that you can help help others and whatever um and that could be the
31:59
simplest most beautiful life never lose sight of what you want because if you
32:07
define success in that way it's terrible in other words because then you're going
32:13
to create an obsession which has no purpose and no ending and no ending yeah
32:21
it's what is it is it a status thing is it a self-indulgent thing so think about
32:27
it as you to acquire more and more money what are you going to do with it are you
32:32
going to overindulge with it and just become you know oh I need more and more
32:40
if you get more money and you do that that's not healthy there's a there's a curse of having too
32:46
little money and there's a curse of having too much money and so when you think about what are you going to do
32:51
with the money um it's very selfish and very decadent to O to to possibly
32:58
consume a lot of money so what's this all about right I think you have to think what's it all about look at
33:05
happiness look at just look around you for happiness who has happiness and what
33:11
in its various forms don't be blinded by this
33:17
commerciality monetary status
33:23
glitchiness uh okay because you won't achieve a happy life but and and the stat or what it's all like
33:30
ephemeral so that would be I would try to convey life is a journey find out
33:36
your path um I I have a principle you know make your um make your um work in your
33:45
passion the same thing and don't forget about the money part you need enough money to make that work well but um
33:54
self-actualize yeah you know I wrote a book recently called abundance which was inspired by a lyric
34:02
from Bob Marley where he said some people are so poor all they have is
34:08
money some people are so poor that's right and I was looking at you know all the data on
34:14
happiness and it came down to very few simple things your attitude towards life
34:20
number one money but that was 10% of the
34:25
happiness that you get every day is 10% is from money yeah but it's only a
34:31
function of the marginal like if you're causing a lot of pain and you have a
34:36
little bit of money that's one thing but it it diminishes in value as you get
34:42
more of it as you get more and then after a while you know you're more
34:49
concerned about your net worth than your s worth it becomes you an obsession blind
34:56
obsession about it and then the last part of you know this data that if you win the
35:02
lottery you'll be ecstatic for about 6 months then it'll plateau in one year
35:08
you'll be back to your old self in two years you may be actually more unhappy
35:13
because now you're worrying about taxes Bahamas this that the other and so money
35:19
adds certain amount extremely poor doesn't help extremely rich
35:26
probably doesn't help and ultimately it boils down to do you know how to make
35:33
other people happy basically I don't I don't know that I know much but I would say happiness by and large is how things
35:41
transpire relative to our expectations that's correct not the absolute level of
35:48
our conditions that's correct so I feel you somebody who doesn't have much money and they get $10,000 they're elated
35:54
somebody's got billions and they lose a 100 million or something and they're still very rich they're depressed so
36:01
happiness is I think how that developed relative to our expectations a reason it
36:06
creates a dilemma because we can become very attached to our
36:13
expectations and as distinct from letting that go and just
36:20
experiencing the the journey which I think produces more joy than being
36:26
attached to our expect ations I agree wouldn't it be great if you could count
36:32
happiness one of the things is you can count money yeah but if we could count
36:39
happiness I think everybody would might focus in it and say how much happiness do you have yeah how much joy happiness
36:46
do you have how much love do you have how much affection attention
36:51
appreciation acceptance gratitude those are the things that make us happy
36:57
according to all the research I've
37:03
read you have something here called principles you personality assessment
37:10
and you have a something called an archetype archelos that's the right
37:17
pronunciation and you define these archetypes as creators Seekers enthusiasts leaders Advocates architects
37:28
Fighters givers and producers you know we are here in a in a
37:34
temple and when people look at these statues they think these are some gods and goddesses out there in The Ether but
37:43
actually these are archetypes that represent the themes that you mentioned how interesting these are archetypes and
37:50
archetypes are defines as states of energy and information and awareness
37:57
if we embody them then we become superheroes or superh heroins so that's the theory how interesting and uh these
38:06
are actually the most important archetypes in all these wisdom Traditions how interesting wow everybody
38:13
has a nature uh and that nature determines their pull and dis discovering one's
38:21
nature uh is very important and also discovering the nature of the people around you is very important because
38:28
it'll Define how your relationship is so I created I I've been doing this for
38:34
decades in in my company you know I I notice people are different um there's somebody who's the
38:40
you know big picture thinker somebody the detail thinker somebody they're going after things and their nature is
38:47
different and it's so important to know your nature and then find your path for
38:53
that nature and to work well with others given a different nature because you
38:59
individually can't have it all and so how you work with others with the nature
39:04
so that there's a commonality of values but there's different skills that come together so as a result I uh worked with
39:11
psychometricians and I wanted to put it out there for everybody free and so principles you it's it's online free
39:18
quick and easy way I'll take it and then share it with you and you can share yours with me great let's do it let's do
39:24
it
Think for Yourself
39:30
Ray one of the things that you know has made you who you are is you're not in a
39:37
rush to conform you know you're not a conformist you're not rushing to
39:43
be like everybody else in fact now people are rushing to be like you
39:50
so do you agree that we have to discover Truth for ourselves and not NE
39:57
necessarily be following Maps doesn't matter who the map was created by an
40:03
Einstein or Jesus Christ or even the Buddha your view on this and mine are uh
40:08
exactly identical I think again um which is to say um that while you can
40:17
learn um you cannot let others have the experiences
40:25
and the choices for you only
40:30
you you can't be hostage that I watch people
40:37
accept and seek approval and as cripples them because
40:44
they lose the sense of what they feel and enjoy how does it taste rather
40:52
than um what am I supposed to think about how it takes
40:57
or who wrote the review for the restaurant right um so um you have to go
41:06
through your life and experience it and say what does it mean without a bias and
41:14
so that's why you need to think independently of course you can learn is that true we're exchanging
41:21
thoughts and so on but you have to think independently
41:27
because you will not have the experiences you will not and there will be no conviction until you
Learning from our Mistakes
41:38
discovered okay so uh deep what we're talking about is is the same thing and
41:44
um and you also have the spiral staircase I have what I call this my
41:50
these Loops in other words life looks like this to me um you know you start
41:55
off and you head in a direction and you evolve and then you have your
42:01
setbacks and the and and the pains and so on and ideally you
42:08
learn and you re adapt and you go on and you have another one of those and it's
42:15
that process through life of learning through the mistakes and the setbacks
42:21
and you keep evolving in that way all the way through yeah um tell me about
42:27
your uh staircase I think it's exactly the same
42:35
what you call failures or or experiences
42:40
that we call painful are always
42:46
recycled unless we learn from them now we use it in a different way the
42:51
terminology Karma recycles karmas means all the lessons that you needed to learn
42:59
if you didn't learn them they would recycle and once you learn them then you
43:05
transcend them you move to the next level and you evolve and you keep
43:11
evolving and evolution is a never ending Horizon it's the journey isn't it funny how we discover
43:18
these things I mean it's just and it's not because we're unique yeah no it's
43:24
because you look at it and it's real
The Importance of Love
43:32
you said earlier that when we look at the wisdom Traditions spiritual
43:38
Traditions um it's not about me and mine and selfishness it's about how we belong
43:44
to a larger ecosystem of uh interdependency or
43:52
inseparability and you also said everybody defines love in their own way way but that is the love is to see that
44:01
it's not me and the world it's the world in Us in you and me includes everything
44:09
and this prefrontal cortex has given us the ability for insight and intuition
44:16
and creativity and archetypal Consciousness and
44:21
Transcendence to me that is love yes that's that to me that's love too because there's a life Arc yes and we
44:30
know what the life Arc is like yeah and we know that that's just a
44:35
minor thing in other words minor and but um but that Evolution continues like
44:43
we're vessels for our DNA correct and it goes beyond and so there is that constant life Arc of which we're a part
44:50
of and we accept it for what it is and then if we can go above it and think
44:56
okay where's my joy enjoy that enjoy that appreciate
45:02
that reality and then when you look above that and so on how do I do that well so I evolve well and contribute to
45:09
Evolution it seems like it's just part of that process and almost every step we
45:14
should enjoy because it is what it is and just
45:19
look at the beauty of
Principles for the End of Life
45:25
it okay so let's talk about principles for a moment I think we agree that there are Timeless
45:33
and Universal realities reality Works in a certain way and I view essential to
45:42
understand how reality works and having principles which means ways of dealing
45:47
with reality to have the best outcome what do you think about principles how
45:53
do you think about principles I think exactly the way you think about principles how reality works then I ask
46:02
myself how can I incorporate these as my inner
46:08
values and uh I usually ask myself questions such
46:15
as who am I what do I want what's my purpose what am I grateful for what
46:23
brings me joy can I remember big experiences and how I felt and why what is a
46:30
meaningful relationship what do I give what do I receive and from that I have created
46:39
what you call principles I call it my soul profile it's the same thing we're
46:44
we had a very interesting conversation about our age yes and approaching death
46:50
correct and uh so as we look above it here we are we know where we are we know
46:56
what's going to to come and how it's going to come and um it's as we think
47:01
about it we have how do we go through that even together how do we deal with
47:07
that and what are our principles in other words the acceptance and just dealing with it in the best possible way
47:14
those are our principles that would be an example of principles approaching death right yeah in the tradition I come
47:20
from there are four phases of life we call them ashrams ashramas which means
47:26
the place we identify as home and so the first 25 years in that
47:32
wisdom tradition is education the second 25 years
47:38
is family taking care of your family and also Fame Fortune success in the
47:46
traditional sense money abundance the third 25
47:51
years is giving back we've been there both of us and this this 4th 25 which
47:58
should be at least 25 if you're in good health is what in our tradition is
48:05
called self-realization to know actually because now in hindsight it's all a
48:10
dream it's all a dream if you ask me what happened to your childhood that's
48:16
it's a dream what happened to your teenage years it's a dream yesterday is a dream this morning is a dream five
48:23
minutes ago is a Dream by the time you hear these words they don't exist so
48:29
both in the east and west wienstein you know the German philosopher said our life is a dream we are asleep but once
48:35
in a while we wake up enough to know that we're dreaming the Buddha said the
48:41
same thing it's lifetime of ours as transient as Autumn clouds to watch the
48:46
birth and death of beings is like looking at the movements of a dance a lifetime is like a flash up lightning in
48:53
the sky rushing by like a torrent down steep Mountain so when he was dying and
49:00
his disciple Ananda said who are you are you God are you a messiah are you a
49:06
prophet he said no none of the above who are you and his last words were I'm
49:13
awake I think that's now the call of the hour for the whole world to wake up from
49:19
The Nightmare we have created literally it's so funny um but grab that uh Little
49:26
Red Book look um because um um I've thought almost
49:34
identically uh three phases of life with Transitions and and they're identical
49:39
okay in other words I say there's the first phase in life uh which is when you're dependent on others um and you're
49:47
learning there then there's a transition and there's a second phase of life when
49:52
others are dependent on you and you're trying to be successful
49:57
and then there's a transition um the transition is the thing I'm in which is when you pass
50:03
things along to others and then there's the last phase in life which um is the
50:10
phrase of freedom and letting go and trans and so on and it's so funny because when as you describe this um
50:19
this is the book in terms of these phases of life and there it's so amazing
50:27
to me as you go down for little details in under each phase you can know what
50:33
that phase is like in a quite detailed way okay at this age then I don't know
50:40
you have your first kiss and then you graduate from school or then you maybe
50:47
get married or or whatever you have a partner and so on and if you look at
50:53
that Arc of life not only in the three phases but in the details of that Ark
50:58
and life you can imagine what your next 10 years of life is so you can see at
51:04
the script and you can imagine not only for yourself but the people you care
51:09
about you can say what is um whether it's your friends your children your
51:16
parents whoever it is and by being able to visualize that you can then decide
51:22
how to approach that because they're going to get older like oh okay where will I be in 10 years where will you be
51:29
in 10 years we can almost visualize that and by doing that it can help us along
51:35
our Arc of life so I think that it's another good example of from our various
51:40
different worlds we see basically kind of the same thing together and we see
51:46
how to navigate it similarly as we talk about where we're going to be and maybe
51:51
together as we approach you know our end of life we are able to approach that
51:57
will yeah you said that very clearly here the last few phases of our
52:03
existence I saw actually a sign on a grave site a while back and it's you
52:10
know there's a sign and there's a grave and the sign says where you are I once
52:15
was where I am you shall soon be that's a good one yes so I think if we remember
52:22
that we can live a more conscious life
Dealing with Death
52:30
I've thought about death since I was uh six years of age uh I was uh living with my
52:38
grandparents and uh that was me about 6 years my
52:44
little brother at that time was three and a half and um uh we were living with my
52:51
grandparents and one day we got a telegram that my father who was in
52:58
England um had passed all his exams he was now member of the Royal College of
53:04
Physicians etc etc Telegram and uh my grandfather who
53:11
was a World War I veteran in the British
53:19
Empire in those days very proud you know my son is now member of the royal
53:25
college that was the colonial thinking so he went on the rooftop he got a rifle
53:31
and shot some rounds in the air that was his way of celebrating then he took me and my
53:38
little brother to see a movie I still remember the name of the movie Alibaba and the 40 thieves then he took us to a
53:46
carnival then he took us to a fancy restaurant restaurant and then in the
53:51
middle of the night he died and uh you know they took him to cremation next day all we saw was a
53:59
bunch of ashes in a jar and one of my uncles
54:05
said um what's a human yesterday was celebrating today's a bunch of
54:12
ashes and I remember at the age of six going into my first existential
54:19
crisis my brother who later went on as I said to
54:24
become dean of education at har but at the age of three and a half he
54:30
started losing his skin started peeling and uh my
54:36
grandmother and uncles with whom we were living they took him to every doctor you
54:43
know and no one could make a diagnosis till one indigenous healer said he's missing
54:52
his parents he's feeling vulnerable and shedding his skin that's a metaphor for
54:58
his vulnerability when his parents come back he'll be fine and so it happened I went
55:06
to medical school thinking I'll figure out life and the first thing you encounter in medical school is a corpse
55:12
you're supposed to understand Life by looking at a dead body so it became an
55:17
obsession with me the mystery of death in biology there's a term called
55:23
apoptosis which is programed cellular death so every cell in your body knows
55:30
to die your skin cells die once a month so new ones can be born your stomach
55:36
cells die every five days your skeleton recycles every 3
55:42
months even the DNA which you mentioned genes that genetic memory holds the
55:49
memory of millions of years of evolution and and evolutionary biology that
55:55
genetic memory but the cells that code it the atoms
56:00
that code it come and go every six weeks like migratory birds so death became for
56:07
[Music] me the ticket to life and I realized
56:13
that death is not the opposite of Life Death is the opposite of birth life is
56:18
the Continuum of birth and death and now of course when people hear me and they say he's Indian he's thinking of
56:25
reincarnation well you could think of it because what recycles is memory you know the stomach
56:32
cells recycle their memory of how to digest food the immune cells recycle their
56:39
memory of how to take care of the rest of the body etc etc so we are the recycling of memory but we are also the
56:48
evolution of that it's like a spiral staircase you know recycle information energy
56:56
matter everything recycles even plastic if you look deeply even plastic
57:02
recycles so everything recycles why wouldn't our Consciousness recycle that
57:09
would be the one and only exception so I believe that what we call this
57:15
Dreamscape which is our projection of our awareness continues the dream continues
57:23
in a different form that's all and this continues but in a different form roomi
57:29
said when I die I will soar with angels but when I die to the angels what I
57:35
shall become you cannot imagine you'll need the imagination of an Angel so
57:41
these archetypes that you talk of these are our guides actually very interesting
57:47
I would say it's somewhat similar but maybe uh different um um I believe that
57:54
we're all part of nature and the little bits and pieces of of us and and matter
57:59
and energy as it keeps uh evolving through time and the bits and pieces um
58:07
fall apart and coales and evolve and I think um there's that force of evolution
58:13
and nature I think nature is perfect and and evolving it's as perfect as I can
58:19
imagine I don't know what comes uh after however I think um the the only issue is
58:26
whether you're attached to what CES came before and it and and it's
58:32
understandable to be attached and then you have to go through that I had my
58:37
personal thing I I lost my son 42 year old son it is uh the most difficult
58:46
thing I mean I would rather die and lose everything I have in in a sense and then
58:51
um but it's like I think about the Serenity Prayer God give me the Serenity to accept that which I can't control and
58:59
the power to control that which I can and evolves and so as you as I go about
59:05
it it's this issue of attachment to something that we it's normal we feel
59:10
and so I think that at my uh deathbed um my attachment for others and
59:17
who I love will be there but that also I'll look at it as in a sense this
59:24
adventure that I'm going on to the this next stage of this inventure because
59:29
there's that ambiguity and whatever it is and I have a sense that it's perfect
59:35
or almost perfect and it's only the issue of the attachment that becomes the challenge I think you're absolutely
59:42
right there's no choice mystery and surrender to mystery yeah
59:48
and savor it and also one of the things I learned and particularly there but I
59:54
mean I learned it in different ways but particularly when it comes home um is to savor what you have and what you have
1:00:02
had and just like you're describing the dream that the movie that exists in I
1:00:08
say wow have I been so lucky to be able to have had that and I'm open to
1:00:14
whatever comes next what an adventure you can't have form without formlessness
1:00:19
so the two go together in the same way as as up and down and hot and gold form
1:00:25
and form this go together I think Consciousness is Cosmos go together as
1:00:31
well I think that's true there's so much uh so much that I'm really eager to uh
1:00:38
discuss with you that we can't we can't uh complete uh we can go
1:00:44
through certain practices which will help you because you are you already
1:00:50
doing Mantra meditation but if we combine that with some of this
1:00:55
witnessing of awareness reflection and a journey to formlessness that's freedom
